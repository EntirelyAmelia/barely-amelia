the sentiment i‚Äôve heard over and over from tumblr folks has been concern for how things will change for the people who rely on the site
and i can say with 100% truth &amp; honesty, that the comments from people in verizon &amp; yahoo do not at all reflect the values of ppl at tumblr
will always be fighting for what‚Äôs right.
the people at tumblr care *a lot* about net neutrality and a lot of other issues. even if verizon tries to shut that down, these folks

that's probably because i was manually lapping so the mile splits are exact and the average pace is gps based
yeah, i really did my best there. lost a little to trying to hit the shade when it was there
a big downhill. i ran mostly even effort through about 20, the time changes were all the hills.

2/ i‚Äôm sure some of you have seen that verizon chose to lay off a chunk of aol &amp; yahoo employees now that the yahoo acquisition is complete

there was no legal or sanctioned way for bobbi to run that race.
when bobbi bandited the boston marathon it was because she could not pay to be in the race because women weren't allowed

bobbi was making a statement and fighting against patriarchy and the exclusion of women. banditing today is in no w‚Ä¶

it's a smallish site, but i want to force myself to use something new (to me) for this project. otherwise, i'd use node or php.

my only complaint about covfefe is that i missed it while i was sleeping like a chump
it's been non-stop hell for the last 2yrs bc of trump, if ppl don't take the bits of fun and joy when they can,they'll never make it through
if you think experiencing joy for a short period of time is a distraction, then you've already lost everything you're fighting to hold on to
heaven forbid people turned off for a bit to have silly fun with something and experience joy in this increasingly joyless world.
if you're mad ppl took a few hours to have a little fun with covfefe last night bc you think it's a distraction, what are you fighting for?

jfc twitter, just let me edit tweets already so i can fix all those typos back there because i'm bad at typing &amp; too impulsive to proofread
obviously, that last tweet should say "buying houses." whatever.
exactly
so get the fuck off our generation's collective back about being goddamn houses
spending more time commuting and being farther from the things we like to do isn't the tradeoff we want to make right now.
or we'd have to move further away from the city which would increase our commutes and decrease our quality of life
to buy a house where we live would cost at least $500k for something we'd be happy living in. at least!
like, we actually can afford to buy a house, but that wouldn't be a good investment for us
for a lot of us, not buying a house is actually the smart and responsible choice, even if we can afford one
and let's not ignore that baby boomers fucked our country in so many ways that actually spending money on a house is rarely a good idea now
there is no winning for millennials. no matter what we do, we're told we're doing the wrong thing.
doesn't even matter what that thing is, whether simply putting food in ourselves or actually enjoying our one miserable life on this planet
and any spending of any money on anything else is seen as some sort of wasteful decadence.
the problem is that millennials are expected to spend exactly $0 on anything that isn't saving for a house or buying fucking diamonds
$150 worth of alcohol 104 nights/year is a completely ridiculous vision of how millennial spend their money, but th‚Ä¶

if i go to a coffee shop with friends or my wife, yeah, i'mma talk to them because that's not taxing for me
a coffee shop that doesn't want me to hang out unless i talk to ppl is missing out on me getting a 2nd/3rd/etc cup of coffee bc i'm leaving
their mental health/issues/quirks/whatever aren't real and could be solved just by being forced to talk to people.
if you're a coffee shop who doesn't offer wifi so people will talk, you're giving so many people the finger and telling them
some people are introverts and being social is intensely exhausting.
and sitting in a coffee shop keeping to yourself is a big win and as good as being social for you.
it's such a slap in the face for anyone who has (social) anxiety. sometimes just leaving the house is a big deal.
i'm really sick of coffee shops that don't offer wifi for the purpose of encouraging people to talk to each other
yes please

headed to corral now
haha! the bag check area is so small. i'm just hanging out in the equivalent spot though
i walked over to see if i could find you and it's pretty crowded over there. damn.
how long is it?

i wouldn't want you too

it's my favorite race distance but it doesn't come without a lot of pain and sacrifice
marathons are dumb
this is one of those really tiny things that is super frustrating
awesome! i'll send an email to the address listed at the bottom of the article! ‚ù§Ô∏è
thanks for sharing your story, isaac! if interested,i'd love to send you an invite to the fb group i started for trans runners
"this person follows and tweets at me, should i follow back?"

*checks their profile*

"hmm runner hmm cats!!"

*mashes follow button*
and it's only $15!
this is perfect from beginning to end!
maybe!
"i took two paychecks because i thought my wife deserved one too"

okay, i'll do this while waiting in lines at disney this weekend. phone will stay in my pocket. maybe.‚Ä¶
yessir!
the fact that i exist makes me inherently evil üôÑ
üê≠ üè∞
please
literally same
you'd think they'd at least try to show real diversity
putting the problem right out on display.
nah, i'm good.
ugh.

i'm going to end up buying a ticket for this stupid thing. ugh.
best pull request title i've ever written
staying healthy for ü¶Ñ is the most important thing for sure
yeah, that's the thing, is a whole year out, but it's easy to get stuck on an injury cycle that lasts that long
omg those people are the worst! like, get some paint, yo
yikes!
it'd be fantastic if i could walk with a cup of hot coffee without spilling it down my leg
oh
the problem is, i really don't know how it will feel or what the situation is with it
yeah, i mean, as a rule, i don't *race* disney races. i just have fun, but even running slow could hurt
hah! she is not running the race
i guess since it's a rundisney race, i could just walk instead of dnfing if i need to, but it's just so a weird mindset to have for a race
my hip is being a jerk and my pt's advice is to see how it goes, but take a dnf if there's pain that's more than a 5/10.
i'm running #starwarshalf and 10k this weekend and it's weird going into it knowing i may need to dnf
i mean, yeah, the whole country is going to start crumbling more and more
i hate that we'd have to move back to the suburbs if we wanted to buy and probably like a whole diff region of the country
like, i just scream "i know i make like twice as much money as you and my budget would be half that!"
seriously, robbie, wtf is going on with your transportation infrastructure down there?
there's hardly an episode of house hunters where my mind isn't broken by these people's budgets
i'm glad i'm not the only one who says jewtalian!!
hate following people is a dangerous game, y'all. be safe out there!

the great thing about air travel is that it's a terrible, dehumanizing experience 100% of the time
i have a boarding pass for tomorrow, but there's no seat assignment on it. only seat options in app are to pay for even more space?
everything should be blueberries
i get this same feeling when driving and my watch is vibrating constantly
nice!!
not ready for this season to end
i'm not sure. i think it might not?
i like pickles too!
i like it for the everything! you gotta try the wasabi ones!
i love seaweed snacks! we stock them at work in our snack zones.
drinking it was basically that in reverse
everyone who had a unicorn frap today should get together for a postmortem to discuss our poop colors
did the sugar kill you like it did me?
all slack instances should have
this is horrifying
it is for like two sips
i hoped to never have to face this reality!
we went over this! the problem is that i really do want this, but i know i'll be disappointed. i can't win.
ugh. jawbreaker reuniting is honestly my nightmare. i hate this.
same :/
i was the only distance runner there so it was a new concept for most of them that this is a thing
it's funny, that's what we were talking about while waiting for our drinks (a bunch of us went), how runners always talk poop
oh
i'm really hoping it makes my poo that color!
yeah, it's a lot of sugar. i got a tall with almond milk to cut down on overall calories. i drank like 2/3 of it.
it died of diabetes
i was curious!
the whipped cream is good!
it's not great, but it's not the worst thing ever
this isn't super good. it's not terrible, but i wouldn't ever order it again. it tastes like liquified fruity pebbles.
yeah. i noticed that too
what have i done?!
and, really, it's just a really weird thing to say to someone.
3) it's insulting to *all* women because it defines the standards of what a woman should look like (i just happen to fit within that)
2) it suggests i'm trying to hide being trans and trick people into not knowing that fact about me.
come on, bro. 1) it suggests i was born a man, which literally zero people are born as. we're all born babies.
no need to worry, folks. a man stepped in to correct me.
yes, i know, i'm the 978263482376th person to make that joke
bill o'reilly shouldn't worry too much, he can still have a career as potus
good luck! report back
like how could this possibly turn out good. they can do nothing but let me down. i'd expect too much.
do not want.
this happens to me every year in disney. it's super weird.
"i would have never known you were born a man" #thingsonlytranswomenhear
i've had this exact thing happen to me
i've been starving myself all week to get back to sports bra shape for the weekend. there's zero chance i'm running in a shirt
yeah, it's gonna be a hot one. glad i had no plans on "racing" it.
please
can't wait to see you there! i get down on friday.

but you did it! you ran boston!!
tumblr volleyball team is about to play its first game. this is gonna be silly.
just feels like i've been constantly bouncing from from one injury/near-injury to another for the last six months.
but it's really messing up my training for grandma's and i've been back and forth on running on it all day.
the thing about my hip is that it's either extremely fucked or maybe not really that bad and i have no idea which one it is.
i love it!
yay! congrats!
never change, never change.
it's a really great race to spectate for! so inspiring to be there
one of our elevators broke with four people trapped in it and we're all watching live video of the dramatic rescue
what the hell is going on in atlanta?!
no, totally, i respect it! i'm just saying it doesn't seem to work out well for american women who say they're going for the win
i don't either
really bummed des didn't do better. i think if you're an american woman, you need to not say you're going for the win in boston. #boston2017
and amazing third place finish for hasay! #boston2017
great win for kiplagat! #boston2017
i just can't get excited for galen rupp. #boston2017
that kiplagat water stop. sheesh. #boston2017
will never tire of seeing that photo of #boston2017
so, uh, kiplagat is going for it here, huh? #boston2017
next year! gah, i can't wait
he is!
did rupp just step on mutai? #boston2017
this is how des races. she doesn't get caught up in pace surges by the lead pack. #boston2017
des!!!!
too early for this race to be this stressful to watch. üò¨ #boston2017
damn, des and meb both dropping back :( #boston2017
6 minute pr for and she was only 4th. wow. #boston2017
seems like it's mostly just that everyone else fell in line with her and she's running her own race #boston2017
beating tatyana mcfadden is impressive on its own, but to beat her by *minutes* is absolutely wild. #boston2017
such a beautiful sight
"whoever gets there first is going to take the win"

huh, is that how it works? #boston2017
des is looking *really* calm and controlled like she's just out for an easy long run #boston2017
she always runs *her* race. if she's out front, that means everyone else is falling in with her
des being out front is reminding me too much of shalane in 2014. hoping it doesn't end up being a repeat of that. #boston2017
probably the best human on the planet, tbh
really strange to be seeing deba dropping off the back of the lead pack. #boston2017
it's really weird to see des out front leading the pack #boston2017
i'm going to miss meb so much when he retires ‚ù§Ô∏è#boston2017

yeah, getting stuck on stuff at work is good. it means you're being challenged. though, it can be frustrating.

"it thinks my penis is a cactus."

an actual sentence i just said that i hope will not be shared out of context.
any time you out a trans person, you are sharing private information about them and putting their safety at risk. don't do it.
and beyond safety, maybe i just don't really want that on that table sometimes? maybe i just wanna be like a normal person.
that safety isn't something you can evaluate for another person.
when i out myself somewhere or to someone, it's only after i've deemed it safe enough to do so.
i'm a preeeeetty out trans women. like as out as you can be. but it's still my thing to share, not yours.
don't out trans people. ever. just don't, okay?
it's okay, i'd eat it too
same! it always felt really weird to me!
that guy was basically snape's son
you gotta have code to have bugs. just sayin'
well, of course, women don't actually like sci-fi
i hear there's also a really cool podcast about it too!

it's okay to criticize things/people you like. your affinity towards someone/something shouldn't make them off limits or lower your bar
empowerment you have to pay for is just a cult.
feminism isn't immunity from criticism
none of this is true except immigrants not wanting to come here anymore. what's it like to be this insecure?

a jungle cruise movie could be cool if done right (it probably won't be). then they'll alter the ride w/stupid movi‚Ä¶
so i guess the media is just gonna suck the hell out of trump's dick now that he's fired off a bunch of missiles. cool. üò°
e.g. large companies making large job announcements.
he hasn't done anything good, but he takes credit when good things he had nothing to do with happen.
remember when he said he cared about syrian children this week?
trump will blame this on obama and "the mess he inherited." good things are his doing, bad things are obama's fault.

oh, absolutely. at the end of the day, it all keeps coming back to how exploitative capitalism is
12/ a number of people also are pointing out lack of sizing for larger women here as well. this also should not be overlooked!
yup! sizing too!
üòû
11/ if you want to actually be inclusive, you need to make products people can afford.
10/ don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs great to see marginalized ppl getting visibility in marketing campaigns,but maybe capitalism is just always bad
9/ and this isn‚Äôt to say only white women have money or all white women do, but‚Ä¶well, wealth is extremely disproportionately distributed.
8/ being inclusive is more than just putting a trans/muslim/black woman in an ad or talking up one or two athletes.
7/ you to sell clothes cheaper, it‚Äôs on you to either figure out how to make it happen or stop claiming to be so inclusive.
6/ if you wanted to make products for all women, your price points would be lower. if you‚Äôre a smaller company and your scale doesn‚Äôt allow
5/ when your tank tops cost $50+, you‚Äôre making it clear that despite what you say, your primary demographic is white women with money.
4/ between shorts, a tank, sports bra, shoes, socks, and headband, that can easily approach $300 for one outfit. that‚Äôs not inclusive.
3/ yet at the same time, their products cost more than anyone who isn‚Äôt upper middle class can afford.
2/ companies will make inclusive advertising or their ceos will talk about how important it is to make products for *all* women
1/ it really bugs me when running clothing/shoe companies talk about being inclusive, but price most marginalized ppl out of their products.

this whole interview w/trump is barely even readable. what is even going on? how can someone be this unhinged?
when you miss typing a word in a tweet about someone else's incoherence
abe simpson is more coherent than our president

this is the saddest thing i've ever read

totally
oh, i certainly wasn't trying to imply any altruism
death of an app with a fraction of the functionality built in to an ios version two years out
i just hope they break before our country does
it's so weird how they're in control of everything right now while simultaneously imploding
of course. broken clocks and all that
certainly weird times when the kochs aren't the most awful ones involved in something
i'm watching now, but when i saw this tweet last night, i knew exactly whom you were talking about
tell me about it

so we're blaming everyone but nazis for the rise in nazism?
yeah, not on the sidewalk of a busy nyc street during rush hour
52% of men have never had sex with a woman outside of procreation. apparently.
i usually don't let the weather win
yeah. it was rough on my way home
i'm very upset about this
the whole thing is so absurd that it can't even be reasoned with in any rational way
you only need to respect those who are real
but, being that i'm not real, that means i'm not subject to humanity's rules or the laws of physics.

so basically, watch the fuck out!
it's true, actually, i'm not real.

i exist solely in humanity's collective imagination as a reminder of its inner depravity.
yawn.
to be fair, it's not just spreadsheets. it's literally anything that allows people to enter text/photos/gifs
such a stupid thing to let happen and i'm not usually like that, but i ugh.
i went back inside without running. i hate myself so much right now, but i lost all will to go out there and run.
it was taking forever and just not catching. after ten minutes, i got tired of the cold wind blowing on me and said fuck it.
okay, i'm really disappointed in myself right now. i got changed to go run and went outside to wait for my garmin to catch satellites.

i had this happen too. along with apps constantly signing me out
the oxford comma is a hill i would probably literally die on
you take that back!
hah. this is the least surprising thing ever
actually, i call things gay all the time now, too. but now they're the things i like.
i'm pretty sure i did this while in college.
you can't let it destroy you,though. we have to remember we can't change the past, but we can use it to be better going forward
same! i think about it every day. i wish i could undo those things. i wish i could fix the past.
that last tweet is missing an oxford comma. i'm very upset about this. i wish we could edit tweets. :(
many of us were probably some of the worst offenders of this as we tried to overcompensate for who we are
instead of denying it, accept it and work towards breaking down the cultures that taught you that hate, bigotry and oppression.
so, yes, you have said (and probably also written) racist, homophobic, transphobic, etc things in your life.
bigotry is learned, but it starts at the earliest points in our lives, before we're mature enough to fully grasp, question, or understand it
when bigotry is cultural we become unknowing perpetuators of it before we're old enough to be able to question it.
i mean, even i'm not even close to innocent here.
if *anyone* says "i have never written a single homophobic or transphobic word in my life,‚Äù they're lying.
man, i guess you didn't see the looks on her face that we all saw in the *video*

this is true. this is also saying a lot
i just mean "humanity's last hope to escape from earth's impending collapse."

like that's maybe not fiction anymore?
13 miles!
it's funny because my favorite racing distances and favorite training/fun distances are mutually exclusive from each other
any training run longer than 13 miles feels like torture to me and i dread it for days to come

he is obsessed with this outright lie
amazon, we need to talk about this
this is good.
cognitive dissonance is strong. it's easier to write things off than to examine you believe, accept you may be wrong
of course, all these tweets i'm sending are pointless. you won't change you mind. you don't care about these things
but, again, you need to be able to see things more than one step out. more than the surface.
almost all of trump's policies can be broken down in a similar fashion to how they actually hurt anyone who isn't rich
things have downstream effects
but see, in order to understand that, you need to be able to think beyond the immediate and obvious
when the us coasts are flooded in a few decades, rich people will just move. poor people will be stuck
and because of income disparity, black people are dispropotionately poor compared to white people
rich people can afford to just move when things get bad in an area. poor people cannot.
over longer terms, the epa (and climate change research/action) ensure livability of our land
that hurts poor people
not having clean drinking water means people have to *buy* bottled water at a significant cost relatively
epa does things like i don't know ensure there's clean drinking water
you simply look for ways to reduce things to their immediate dollar cost
problem with republicans is y'all don't think about things over the long term or broader impact
removing epa will kill black people and many other poor people
the oxford comma is good!
maybe america isn't actually a great nation
except i'm not mad? but don't fall back on that whole joke like because your hypocrisy is is showing. you meant what you said
you're saying liberals should pay for the things *you* don't like.all i did was rework that to be about the things we don't like
also, you're too dense to even get the argument here, aren't you?
oh, right, because mexico is never paying for that wall as trump had promised they would.
is it good?
is it good?
then you'll have no problem funding that stupid wall on your own. and melania living in nyc. and trump's trips to mar-a-lago.
you're not here to do work. you're here to shitpost.
