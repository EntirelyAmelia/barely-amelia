So he's not even going to try to be "presidential?" But pundits will still grade him on based on a bar that's fallen to the ground and then rolled into a bottomless pit.

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever tweeted about trail mix how does the bot know about trail mix???  
Since moving to Jersey City,    and I have spent our NYEs playing party games with   and   . Now that they‚Äôve moved to Atlanta, we‚Äôre trying to find party games we can play remotely.
Please, for the sake of all that is good (if good even still exists), Instagram. 

Instagram and Facebook ads are like gender dysphoria minefield.

This is basically what I‚Äôve slowly been trying to achieve over the last few years, but actually articulated into words  
This damn woman in Crocodile
Me: I‚Äôm not going to blow all my gift cards right away! I‚Äôm going to save them for later.

Also me: *blows all her gift cards five days after Christmas*

Coffee, Rapid Reboot compression sleeves, cats, and Ash vs The Evil Dead. Not a bad way to spend your morning.
This seems like something that should be getting more attention  
When your run is unexpectedly icy with a thin layer of snow hiding the ice, it really pays to know your route so well that you know where every single puddle forms so you can avoid slipping on ice.
All I wanted to do was put ONE cardboard box into the recycling and this happened  
My hands are killing me today. Every. Single. Time. I type `:w`, they add a damn `q`.
Hi, I was wrong. These colors have grown on me and now I think I love the design and can't wait to get one. (Though, I would still prefer the more classic blue with yellow colors)  
This is really good and worth a watch if you care at all about what it's like to be a trans woman simply existing in public space.  
Who do I need to add to my #runDisney #WDWMarathon Twitter list for this year?
Healthy food costs more.

Gym access costs money.

Workout clothes cost money.

Working out requires having time to workout. ‚ÄúMaking time‚Äù almost always requires a certain level of financial stability.

And this is just the monetary cost aspect.  
Exactly this.

Same goes for the existence of LGBT (especially T) people. We've always been around in the same kind of numbers. We only recently started feeling safe and having platforms to come out of the shadows.  
These #TheLastJedi takes make me like the movie more and more with each day.

(spoilers, obvi)  
280 has made me so lazy with how I compose tweets. Less succinct, more verbose.
I‚Äôve been coding for 12 years (10 professionally) and I still love typing stuff into a computer that makes it do new things.

It‚Äôs challenging and exciting, but easy to fall into a rut if you don‚Äôt change it up as soon as the challenge disappears from you projects.  
This episode of Mythbusters is testing if banana peels are actually slippery.

I wish I hadn‚Äôt waited all day to read this thread  
NYPD is problematic af still, but notice how NYC continues to get more and more diverse yet the crime rate continues to drop?  
Of course Twitter doesn't see any issue with the account that literally searched my tweets to find things to fuel their bigotry and screenshot to incite their fellow bigots to attack me. 

Of course, Twitter is okay with this. Because   is pro-nazi.
Geez, I had no idea Stan Lee is 95 years old.
I was actually too warm for most of my run, despite 0¬∞ windchill  
I should take advantage of working from home and go for a #runch, but I don‚Äôt wanna!  
Do y'all remember that time when Yoda and Obi-wan didn't hide for decades between trilogies?  
Why am I wasting my morning arguing with a guy on Twitter about Star Wars?
The truly sad thing about #TheLastJedi is it's the first Star Wars movie to introduce plot holes. üôÉ  
If anything, the reaction of some men to #TheLastJedi just proves how little they understand storytelling and the real world.
It's not a reboot. It's a continuation of a story and, in that story, there's a progression that happens which results in Luke becoming a "cynical failure" and the Jedi becoming a religion that "should be burned down."

It's not a story if there's no progression.  
lol okay  
Uh huh  
I can be pretty fucking white and also think white people are a problem and need to get their shit together. Both of those things can be true.  
These people are such anti-Semitic and racist fucks that they will go SEARCHING through your old tweets to find ways to be bigoted towards you.

Like they can't even bear the thought of just not being horrible nazi racists.  
Has anyone had luck with pheromone collars for cats? Our vet suggested trying one for Leela before we try medicating her for her (extreme) emotional imbalances.

We‚Äôre taking all four cats to the vet today for their annual checkups and shots. Pray for us.

As for fecal samples, I grabbed four random ones from the litter boxes and am hoping for the best. They‚Äôre probably all Leela‚Äôs.
What a bean!  
Yes. Obviously.  
As 2017 ends, I wrote a bit about how much my life has changed since the final days of 2007. It's unfathomable.    
Sorry, can‚Äôt work today. I‚Äôve come down with a case of cat lap.  
I agree with most of this. 

Two months in and I really love the iPhone X. It makes all other iPhones feel wrong.

It‚Äôs interesting watching people who have their own shitty track records drag Vice (and others). Maybe just ü§ê and sit it out because you‚Äôre not much better?
I hate this. I can hear you breathing hard trying to keep up. I know that‚Äôs not sustainable for you.  
May or may not have just impulse bought a pair of Rapid Reboot recovery sleeves as a gift to ourselves.

I had made it this far without hearing Last Christmas this year and then   ruined it all
On one hand, you gotta hope this would fracture the Trump base, but since it's America, he'd somehow win because we'd obviously find a way to elect someone even worse than Trump  
I tried to explain Sleep No More to my mom last night and now she wants to go. Watching her experience it will be its own experience.
Gosh, this sounds so terrible üôÑ  
Has anyone else noticed the iPhone X seeming to be more aggressive with automatically re-trying FaceID on the lock screen with one of the last updates? I almost never have to force a retry anymore.
Seriously, traveling while trans is a nightmare.

Luckily, the only issue I've had is a TSA agent taking my dilators out and waving them around (he wasn't being transphobic, he legit didn't know what was in my bag, but it was so awkward).

Still, it's terrifying every time.  
Wait, I thought we were saying "Merry Christmas" again?  
First thing I said after walking into the office today was "there better be an everything bagel left or I'mma cut someone."

I guess I'm feeling comfortable here now.
It appears I am one mile from my yearly mileage PR and I‚Äôve got seven more runs planned before the end of the year. #runchat

Ah, there's that flip

This is a surprise useful update to Twitter. But it would be nice if they also improved the 3rd party API in regards to threads as well.  
I don't think many of us really consider the cognitive load we put on ourselves by having to communicate via a dozen different platforms at any given time.

That's not how this works. You're not talking about what being trans means, you're just (rightfully) calling out problems with the gender binary and gender norms.

But this isn't what dysphoria is. You're neglecting the entire physical component of it.  
Typical cheap short-term solution that costs orders of magnitude more in the long run.

Trump demands complete loyalty from everyone he works with, but will never show an ounce of loyalty to anyone in return
This is something we should be cheering. This is how a civilized society functions.  
Holy shit  
Take a run at everyone. Literally all of them.  
While ppl are praising McCain, maybe remember he could have single-handedly allowed you to sleep last night by voting no in the first place
This country is so fucked up that waking up to find out you still have healthcare is exciting and good news
I woke up to news that McCain found some semblance of a spine last night.

Everything about this country is so absurd right now.

Transphobe: *unfounded, factualy incorrect garbage*

Transphobes are OBSESSED with other people's genitals. They are perverted sexual predators.  
I asked to be treated like a human  
How do you know what genitals someone has? What are *you* doing in the bathroom???

If you're mad ppl took a few hours to have a little fun with covfefe last night bc you think it's a distraction, what are you fighting for?

If true, the fact that being president is destroying him and making him miserable may be the only silver lining to this administration  
It's almost as if systematic oppression can have serious effects on your health    
So MRAs and alt-right weirdos are still calling people cucks like it's insulting to anyone, huh?
More white men commit mass killings in America than anyone else so maybe the problem isn't muslims, maybe it's literally *islamophobia*  
There are like 1.6 BILLION muslims on Earth and like 6,000 in ISIS. That's 0.000375%.

More white American men kill people w/guns annually  
literally accurate

If you were starting a new personal project today, what tech stack would you use?
At least Target is inclusive of the trans while profiting off Pride

I don't know who did this, but it's perfect

This was surprisingly really interesting to read  
Can't believe all these snowflakes trying to stop free speech by getting outraged over a little body slamming üôÉ
Before I get sucked down into today's version of the hell we live in, I'mma take a moment to reflect on my wonderful rain run this morning
Remember when Trump said only he can make us safe from terrorism?

This sure is an interesting strategy, but we should trust him.

I want to live in a house made of bagels. But the bagels don't go stale or rot. And there are no doors so I have to eat my way out.

Got a good laugh watching   literally try to herd cats this morning after they all ran out the door
I spent 6 hours wandering around Manhattan without a phone today. It wasn‚Äôt terrible.
Look this is absurd, but I don't want to be friends with 100% of people anyway so whatever fuck you  
Bad idea: ordering IPAs by the liter at 9:30am on a completely empty stomach after a half marathon
#AirbnbBKHalf done! Hip was mostly okay, can't complain.

Got the results of my MRI today. It showed nothing. Literally nothing. Basically, doctor says to just keep doing what I'm doing
It takes some kind of snowflake to think you're entitled to other people's time, energy, and debate.

Just saw La La Land for the first time. It's not very good.

Given this, it seems as though Ryan should go down with Trump  
"pro-life administration"  
The #rickmobile came to tumblr HQ today!  
So I could eat my way out of it every time I need to pee?  
Paul Ryan doesn' t care about anything now that Trump helped him take healthcare away from the poors  
This actually sounds ideal.

Very different meaning.
My personal brand is so weird that it doesn't matter what you think  
Nothing. Literally nothing. They are going to do nothing.

Because they are cowards and care more about tax cuts than the country.  
The only real problem with dudes wearing rompers is they'll be able to pee without getting naked in public bathrooms because patriarchy

More hope that other countries are paying attention to the hellfuckery that the USA and UK dove into and are running far away from it  
A thing I've been thinking about lately is which states will join together to form smaller countries when the USA completely breaks
"he'll do what he wants to" isn't quite how our government should be run or is designed to run or how any democracy runs

False! Your mind HAS to know what's coming. And it has to embrace that. That's the only way to have a strong marathon.  
Pretty sure this isn't going to be possible.

Imagine being proud of #AHCA. Also, imagine being Paul Ryan.  
It is disappointing that the GOP / Trump weren't forced to carry #AHCA to term.
Take a second and breathe, everyone!

But just one second because Trump / GOP aren't done screwing us.

There are zero good arguments for this. This basically is an attempt to push certain people out of existence.

Republicans and transphobes say men shouldn't be in women's rooms, so why are they trying to put this boy in the women's room?

Can I get a pet fox? Is that a thing I can do? I'd really like a pet fox.

Can Spicy get through just *one* press conference without fucking up?  
This thread puts some important perspective on current nazism  
This is the 2nd yr in a row I swore up and down I wasn't going to do #DopeyChallenge again,yet here we are üò´üôÉ #runchat #bibchat #WDWMarathon  
On this day of love, here's a post I wrote 3yrs ago about my love for the marathon. Still 100%true   #runchat #bibchat  
A lot of love for   this morning  
A goodbye to my favorite running shoe üò¢ #runchat    
Today was the kind of morning where the alarm goes off, I *get out of bed to run*, and then decide to get back into bed instead.
Thanks for being my valentine,  !!  
I can't take this headline seriously  
I went to bed before the Flynn news broke. I woke up and was just like "damn, that was quick"
What the hell, white people?! Seriously, we gotta be better than this.  
Sooo our  ? You're going to take measures against  , right? RIGHT?!  
My blog post tomorrow is a lengthy goodbye to my fav running shoe model that Im not allowed to wear anymore.Y'all gonna think I lost my mind
This is when I walk out of the store without what I went for  
Geez,   is everywhere these days
Why? Why would you do this? This is absurd. I take this as a personal attack.  
Anyone keeping running tally of countries that will be banding together against us in WWIII?  
I will never stop missing the days when fewer than half of my tweets needed to be about politics/activism/apocalypse/inequality
Conservatives intro legislation to limit my access to bathrooms, deny recognition of my marriage, and make it easier to fire me. That hurts.  
I think we should hear these people out and engage their death wishes with dialogue. I'm sure they'll change their minds.  
Like, what the hell is it going to take to get this guy impeached?

He's probably the biggest threat to our nation we've ever seen.  
This breaks my heart into a thousand pieces. I will never in million years understand how people can be so cruel.  
This language is so utterly disgusting I don't even know how to properly describe it. This is extreme patriarchy.  
It cannot be overstated how extremely not okay this is  
But, Phil, why would I want to stay on Earth? All the bad things in the world are here on Earth.  
This. Is. Very. Not. Okay.

This is a really good read about the negative long-term effects of internet markets.  
Every year, this guy gets on the stage and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúman, what a doofus.‚Äù #grammys
bingo  
Why was that Beyonce performance in the middle of the show and not the end? #grammys
A6: Running constantly and not feeling like I'm on the verge of injury all the time. Need to be better at mobility/strength work #runcat  
This is fascism. Government should ALWAYS be open to questioning and criticism.  
A3: Some anti-Trump ones. Give me a socks that say feminist, pro-LGBT, black lives matter, pro-immigrant, resist, etc. #runchat  
A2: The laundry and race fees and how much work injury prevention is #runchat  
A1: The solitude also, the 65789065 calories I tell myself it's okay to consume after. #runchat  
Hey #runchat! I'm Amelia from Jersey City. Weird place I've ever run is the time I did laps back and forth in my living room for a mile  
Oh wow, looks like weird Lady Gaga is back! I missed weird Lady Gaga! #grammys  
Sure, ppl need to listen to each other more, absolutely. Unless they're nazis, in which case nobody should be listening to them for anything
WTF is Katy Perry wearing? #grammys #ERedCarpet
Looks like mylar space blankets are the in look this year on the #ERedCarpet at the #Grammys
Massive numbers of protestors lining the road that FAKE PRESIDENT refuses to mention. Very dishonest!  
How long until Republicans outlaw this? It directly goes against their party platform of lives only mattering prior to birth.  
Cauliflower yum yums  
Does my protesting paycheck count as regular or bonus earnings? I need to know how it's taxed.
Danielle is threatening to use her bonus on Normatec leg sleeves and I'm tempted to encourage this
This woman is going around saying she's the first transgender woman to qualify for Boston. She's not.  
Trying my first treadmill class today. I'm pretty sure there's zero chance of me enjoying this, but we'll see! #runchat
I what?  
If you read some of the language, this is also some patriarchical bullshit  
Extremely pro-life. Imagine hating children this much.  
Danielle conned me into trying a Mile High Run Club class with her tomorrow. Blarg.
This cat  
No.   is a lost cause who is actively harming trans people. She needs to be stopped.  
Nice second place finish for   in the Wanamaker Mile! #NYRRMillroseGames
Definitely odd seeing   not in Oiselle #NYRRMillroseGames
Excited to watch   in the #NYRRMillroseGames  500m!
Why is NBC promoting the 2018 Winter Olympics so hard already? Chill your fucking jets, NBC.
Always love the #NYRRMillroseGames!

And I love Desiree Bryant's "be the change" tattoo
Thank you so much for that hat,  !!!!  
Good reason to run on a slushy West Side Highway   City Bakery  
How did this country get to the point where children are treated like the enemy?  
Oh jfc. Enough.  
Nazis are weird.  
Stop deporting people, you ass. I don't care what the legality is of them being here is.  
This is so beyond fucked up.  
Now is a good time to repeat that I firmly believe we should abolish all borders and immigration should be totally open.  
I would love a marathon medal rack with this on it  
That's one hell of a sentence  
I'm sure it's fine. He has the best temperament!  
Really great interview with   on The Daily Show last night!  
That's a very serious procedure and one shouldn't rush into it  
Remember the band Shelter? Not as good as I remember :(
Of course they are  
It's almost as if he had no idea what the job was or how our government works
   
You're inspired by a child picking through trash to get an education?

This is sad, not inspiring. Education shouldn't require this.  
Hell no.  
A lot of doubts about the authenticity of this account,BUT it's hard to believe the people he surrounds himself not wanting revenge if fired  
At least it wasn't I choo-choo-choose you. amirite?!    
A3: Wearing shorts and sports bras 3-4 times between washes. #imgross #nuunchat  
Looks like   also took his caps lock key to Instagram as well  
Say what you want about Hillary Clinton, but she wouldn't be yelling at judges on Twitter
You'd think for someone who spends more time in court than most lawyers, Trump would know when he just lost there
I love the random people who come out of nowhere to tweet an insult at you and then immediately block you. Like, what's the point?
Uh, you just were in court. You lost.  
Take a moment and think about this. This happened because we fought for it. We took to the streets and stood up.  
Waiting for the   twitter meltdown over the #MuslimBan
Our country's   is his own parody.  
üëè stop üëè yapping üëè and üëè start üëè taking üëè action  
Supporting a person/company that, in turn, supports Trump is supporting a dangerous administration with zero regard for marginalized people  
Exceptions find a way  
Exceptions find a way  
This isn't a good long term strategy and will absolutely backfire on them, but I'm sure Twitter knows what they're doing  
Some   vitamins to hydrate my snow day. #nuunlove  
Like, the mission failed in pretty much every possible way.

  /  , y'all are cowardly liars.  
Sean, that's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.  
Current status: Just asked   to get me a liter of coffee
I know DeVos is going to have all the history books burned, but if we survive this admin, they will not be kind to GOP/Trump when rewritten
This is incredibly pro-family  
How do people focus on or think about anything besides the destruction President Shitshow is unleashing on this country? I don't know how.
Guys, I'm starting to get a bad feeling about Donald Trump being President
I feel like my coworkers judge me for how much food I eat
Ugh. I said the same thing to multiple people this morning.  
I'm trying to come up w/something to say about Sessions&amp; I've got nothing. It's just another angle of attack against the ppl of this country
Actually, yeah, everyone should have the right to a meal, housing, and the ability to have an income. These shouldn't be privileges.  
I've sunk down into one of those phases where I lose all motivation to run and spend all day feeling guilty about it üòï
A lot of people seem to have missed the part where she campaigned for her father and is deeply involved in what he does.  
tfw "deplorable cunt" with username "huuugedick" says you have issues ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  
You know, you can oppose someone without threatening sexual assault  
You're right Mr Egg, I don't respect   and I absolutely never will. He isn't worthy of respect.  
Called me "Tranny" (capitalized) and "it" in the same tweet. Nice double-down!

But why the quotes around it?  
If "security" requires restricting the rights of some people and access to our country to entire groups, we don't deserve that security

Important thread  
Republicans have made it extremely clear their platform strictly prioritizes hate &amp; bigotry above ALL else. Even $. How fiscally responsible  
You wouldn't know the right thing if you fell into an ocean of it  
Using Slack threads to troll the hell out of   this morning
Merge conflicts like whoa this morning
I think this is a legitimate question  
Y'all sell Star Wars themed stuff, but you're praising Darth Vader.  
I'm glad   let   have his safe space last night. Important to protect senators from dissenting arguments.
There is no way he is *this* oblivious. He's a liar.  
I was having a fantastic hair day today until my physical therapist made me sweat üòï
This is their plan. Drive Muslim hate to fuel terrorism and then use it to take full control.  
An upbeat, positive, and inclusive environment that has *occasional* distractions, but has long periods of quiet #DevDiscuss  
There you have it folks! Google suggest doesn't lie. Sad!

I can honestly say I've never put a doughnut in my pocket before today
While you're lifting weights, we'll be over here actually getting shit done, bro.  
Why do Republicans hate women?  
You are a terrible person.

Why do Republicans hate children?  
What is wrong with you? Democrats voted against her. All of them.

You're seriously the worst, Jill.  
Another party in my mentions today.

God forbid you make a typo in a tweet. Sheesh.

My legs are sore from snowboarding on Saturday. What the hell, legs? You're not new to this. Get it together.
Love when an amber alert sets off every phone in the office in unison
This is fantastic, conservatives actually think it's the left being mocked in Idiocacry. Like, have you actually seen the movie? LOLOLOLOLOL  
This guy thinks he's witty by quote RTing me with an Idiocracy reference  
Eric doesn't seem to grasp that language evolves over time to fit needs.

Also, singular they isn't even new. Shakespeare used it.  
Just had a guy freak in me because I bumped into his fully opened newspaper in an extremely crowded PATH car. Oh, my bad!
If NYT is failing so badly, why is he still so obsessed with trying to take them down? It's almost as if he's actually threatened by them.  
WhaaaaaaatTF?

  I'd like a full refund of the purchase price of my TV.  
These people on House Hunters are making house-buying decisions based on their cats' needs and, like, yeah I get it. Same.
This is not good  
Trump is good on terrorism  
Boy, it sure is going to be great when we go to war against Germany again and this time we're the bad guys  
Just think how many more Bowling Greens there may have been that we'll never know about because of the liberal Jew media covering them up

Talking to my mom about punching nazis and she goes "sometimes you have to out bully bullies."
Turns out that not being okay with white supremacy makes you a sore loser  
Have you considered maybe just not welcoming him instead?  
Or Apple could just use USB-C on iPhones/iPads and we could all just have one connector for everything. But that'd be silly  
Whoever wrote this code I'm trying to fix is a jerk and I don't like them and they took a lazy way out instead of writing better code
Trump is such a fucking dickhole. He's not even the whole dick, just the hole.
As POTUS, this would be really easy for   to prove. If it were true. Which it's not.  
So how's your afternoon going?  
Oh, come on, Apple. Knock it off with this shit.  
I hate computers.
I can't overstate how amazing these sleeves are. If I could, I'd buy my own pair.  
I wonder what it's like being the kind of person who thinks "I can't believe &lt;company&gt; showed black/brown ppl in their commercial! BOYCOTT!"
Serious discussion going on over here over which animals are allowed to be discussed in the frogs and fish channels in Tumblr Slack
You could easily prove this by firing Bannon and releasing your tax returns. Think about it, man.  
Imagine being President and tweeting this

The Patriots won the #SuperBowl, but we still have Lady Gaga and the commercials
Trump's tweets are going to be so annoying
Well, that happened.

At least this time it's just a football game and not the apocalypse

Punch nazis, sack Bradys. üá∫üá∏
I *really* enjoy watching Brady get sacked.   keeps yelling at me for cheering too loudly every time. #SuperBowl
This year's #SuperBowl feels like a celebration of all that is good in America and all that we fight for. #sb51
You're both a sore loser and a sore winner.  
Someone punch this guy again  
All Hair Matters? #SuperBowl
EAT THAT BRADY! #SuperBowl
WTF is going on with this Mr Clean commercial? #SuperBowl
You must have missed all the gay then  
That was fantastic,  ! #SuperBowI #PepsiHalftime
Look, Gaga is putting on a great performance, but this is no Three Doors Down #PepsiHalftime #SuperBowI
also me  
That's a lotta drones #SuperBowI #HalftimeShow
Neil, you tweet this every fucking year.  
I really like the score of this game right now. #SuperBowl
Oh great, so you mean they'll have the most points, but still lose somehow  
America is getting *real* wonky, y'all  
If you're wearing a suit to a Super Bowl party, I don't even know what to tell you  
Say what you will about us, but no couple cracks each other up the way   and I do
#BaiBaiBai made me laugh more than it should have
Anyone start collecting screenshots of racists melting down over #SuperBowl commercials yet? #weaccept
What really bothered me about that oil commercial was the implication that rockets are powered by oil #superbowl
Rickrolled by a commercial in 2017
Which of the companies w/commercials embracing diversity will be the one whose stock Trump tries to tank w/a tweet tomorrow? #superbowl
Oh, FYI, fuck the Patriots. Fuck Tom Brady. Fuck Belichick. #SuperBowl
Damn, this egg sure loves to yell. Their tweets are like that all the way down. Don't see any tweets that aren't replies yelling at people  
oooooh people gonna be mad about this Coke commercial #SuperBowl
Can't wait for our so-called "President" to live "tweet" the "Super" Bowl
Wait. This says Super *Bowel*. I bet it'll be quite a movement! üôÉ  
Oh god, I hope so! 

Can I be one of those sacrificed?  
If something happens, I'm probably going to be blaming white dudes with guns and the GOP caving to the NRA since that's who it usually is.  
Capitalism is stupid  
It me and Fry  
I will never chill regarding Trump. Not one day until he is out of office.  
Care to elaborate whose lives you're referring to? And please be sure to show your work.  
And people didn't do that to Obama? He didn't whine about it.

Quit being crybabies, snowflakes.  
Beautiful day for üèÇ!   Killington Mountain Resort &amp; Ski Area

This isn't the snowboarding helmet I just bought  
Really is a sorry state of affairs for trans health  
Literally me and everyone I know

ANYWAY, you know what's not awful? Me being on I'll Have Another Podcast today!  
This shit-nacho's previous tweet was a GG Allin quote. The irony here is fantastic.  
Real upset about what "botched lobotomy" has to say here.  
This one who, I'm sure, thinks immigrants don't work their asses off more than most people here just to survive  
This one with 109 followers basing an argument against me based on Twitter follower counts  
There's this guy who thinks the people speaking out against white supremacy and genocide are the nazis  
This tweet is doing wonders for dropping a ton of shitbags who don't know what punk is into my mentions.  
Tumblr employees donated $80k to  ! There are fewer than 400 of us. I'm so proud of my coworkers!  
This really scares me right now. This is such an important case.  
I'm not being sarcastic at all when I say that this is still too subtle.  
No, it's not. And it never will be.  
Yeah, it's an inconvenience to the people who have to fill out paperwork for 100k visa revocations. Think of the hand cramps they must have  
I'm pretty sure this year has been the least Super Bowl talk I've ever seen. It's nearly non-existent. You know things are bad.
What could be better than two former Women's Running cover runners chatting?  
This always bothers me. Be careful who else is being taken down by your words. Don't take down all ppl w/mental illness. Same for fat ppl.  
I guess I can quit my day job now if I'm going to be getting paychecks for all these protests üíµüí∏üí∞üòú  
I'm on the latest episode of the I'll Have Another podcast! Give it a listen!

Having a cat party over here  
Every day is Groundhog Day if you're Bill Murray
Maybe then the GOP would care about HIV/AIDS treatment?  
I honestly don't even know that I'd still be in one piece after the last two weeks if not for starting Lexapro in December
Truth  
Y'all think runDisney races start early? I just bought a ticket for a snowboarding day trip that starts at 3:30am
like why?  
We have a large, powerful military, but I don't know that we'd survive against China, Australia, Mexico, and most of the Middle East at once  
WTF?! How is this okay?

Is it because Trump is receiving updated orders from Putin and needs to hide being a puppet?  
Current mood.

Should probably hide in a closet for the rest of the day so Trump can't ruin it  
Damn. Rough predictions coming from the groundhog front.  
Maybe go back and revisit the Tea Party, Merrick Garland's confirmation, how Rs treated Obama, and what Rs promised if Hillary won  
Most arguments in the Tumblr "holy-war" Slack channel end in me saying "fuck javascript."  
People who think free speech means freedom from consequences or the right to a platform don't deserve free speech in the first place
He's the President, we should worry about everything he does  
Ban lightning!  
Fuck Sheryl Sandberg  
Trump really is trying to make it US against the world  
When the GOP goes unchecked they engage in cartoon levels of villainy  
I forgot this was tonight! Something good to look forward to!  
One thing I've seen happening since Trump is a lot of people I never thought would get political or protest getting involved and fighting
So how's your programming going today? I'm opening pull requests like this  
It's #BlackHistoryMonth, make sure you're spending time listening to black people.
On the plus side, my physical therapist seems nearly 100% sure I don't have a stress fracture.

Have a doc appointment for tomorrow morningü§û
So people still think Dems shouldn't be obstructionist?  
Where are all my pro-life, pro-family Republicans at?!

Huh? What's that?

Oh, right, you didn't actually mean all lives and all families  
"Holy shit, how is Donald Trump President?!" - the thing stop and scream at least once a day
A6: The correct answer is more chocolate. Other acceptable answers: ice cream, peanut butter, pretzels

This isn't how TV ratings work. You are measured in stream numbers if you watch online, not included in ratings watching on TV  
This is the most I've laughed since 1/20  
NYC/Jersey City where are tonight's protests? I don't think I can go, but I want to RT for others. #MuslimBan #resist #NoBanNoWall
But I don't WANNA be on-call!! WAHHHHHHHHHH!!
Do your duty (source:    
This isn't how you behave when you think you're doing the right thing or standing up for good. You do this when you know you're the bad guys  
Ugh.  
I look at my three cats daily with envy anymore. It must be so nice to not be aware.  
Never forget.  
It's really starting to seem like I have a stress fracture in my foot and now is not the time for me to not be able to run.
Hey, uh you missed. Try again?  
More likely is he's waiting for FADA because that will be far more reaching and backlash will be spread across the whole GOP, not just him  
Thread  
Is your argument that if someone wasn't ALWAYS fighting that hey should never get started or involved?  
People like this think some of us only just got political and opening our mouths.  
Thank GOD we didn't elect Hillary Clinton! Imagine how boring of a President she'd be! She'd just have her head down getting work done!
Literally not the Attorney General.  
How many people still work in the Executive Branch at this point?  
Day 11 and Trump's presidency is already going about as well as you'd expect
Not that she betrayed the law. Or the people. Or the constitution. Because she didn't betray any of those.

That she betrayed Trump.  
The people who believe the Bible means anything to Trump are the same who believe it means nothing to Obama  
Well, that's about right.  
Seriously questioning if we'll wake up to a country that still exists tomorrow
What a disaster  
Now even NASCAR drivers are standing up against Trump.  
Did they learn this? Are   capable of learning this lesson? I'll believe when they show us.

"New political order"

Just go ahead and call it the First Order

I like Capaldi a lot, but I think his series have suffered from a lot of poor writing.

Please use two Ss when spelling "transsexual"  
First immigrants and Muslims. Next, LGBTQ people.  
We knew this was coming. Terrified of what exactly it'll be.  
How do you make a policy like this?

This "dude" has no concern for anything.  
Protesters are about as terroristic as the people who founded this country.

Protesting and standing up to fascism is patriotic.  
You're right  Ban robots and automation!!

People are more important than your stock price!  
What a small group of people  
Tell me about it, man  
Where are all our Republican reps screaming "The Constitution!"?  
Until the world improves, the vocal resistance will continue.  
These nazis need to stop asking for it  
It's equally likely that Trump is giving the courts the finger and that he literally doesn't know how the government works  
Okay, now I'm also on the same side as the Koch Brothers on something? Good god.  
These photos sadden me. In NYC, elected officials were apart of protests and rallies. Cops in #BatteryPark supported.  
These photos sadden me. In NYC, elected officials were apart of protests and rallies. Cops in #BatteryPark supported.

Goodbye  . I'll be using   instead. #deleteUber  
Quit tweeting about not backing down and start actually standing the fuck up with your actions.  
Pence will come off as level-headed and centrist compared to Trump and that is terrifying beyond words  
If you want me to tweet about other stuff, you're going to have to stand with me and fix everything that's more important first.

Where is the resistance from these companies?  
Utterly disgusting. Each day he's been in office, I've become more and more ashamed to be American. #MuslimBan  
This guy *literally* didn't have a heart for years.  
How is any of this even comparable to any single one of Trump's horrors, let alone all of them, you shit weasel?  
So did     416 days ago  
Donald Trump is bad.
Not sure if I'm sad or jealous, to be honest  
Just catching up on the last few hours. Seems the Trump hand photoshop wasn't a real thing. Sorry for RTing it üòï
It's almost like America doesn't actually like Trump and he doesn't represent us at all. Sad!  
But it's trans people who are the weirdos obsessed with genitals. Y'all cis folk are strange.  
The garbage is coming so fast you can't even tell which horror it was that pushed people over

The election of a new president shouldn't result in my timeline being flooded with tweet after tweet for suicide hotlines.
And what's worse is the people responsible for this would call this a win.  
Great advice for those with the privilege to do so, but not everyone can put their lives on the line like that.

Okay, so how long do we have to stay in this hell world until we can slide to the next dimension?  
Try to get marriage license reissued w/proper name/gender or leave w/birth info on so it can't be voided if marriage equality is overturned?
Lots and lots of people giving each other hugs at work today. It's needed.
Yeah, couldn't agree more, actually.  
White people, you voted *for* this.  
Tumblr staff is already working on how we're going to move forward and help those who are marginalized and need help

Yeah? Wanna double check how the polls worked out?
Those saying we have checks and balances, do you not realize they were voted out the window yesterday? There will be none for at least 2yrs

WE WEREN‚ÄôT SUPPOSED TO BE THE ONES HAVING THE MELTDOWN!

A few things that will end in 2017:

Exactly. I want him and the GOP to have ride this out. You don‚Äôt get to drop this hellstorm on us and then just walk away.  
Unfortunately, the GOP have a real problem with understanding cause and effect. Also, consequences.  
We need to stop pretending Trump doesn‚Äôt represent GOP values. That is exactly what he represents, in their purest and rawest form.
So you‚Äôre going to not vote for the vocal misogynist and instead wrote in the guy who has legislated against women?  
Think of all the things Trump has said that haven‚Äôt been recorded or tweeted.

Then join me in volunteering for the first trip to Mars.
Yes.   Goddess and the Baker  
I get really anxious in places without a strong jaywalking culture
#ChicagoMarathon training recap!    
This is the more extreme end of it, but not uncommon from my experience in male-only spaces  
Ironic how pro-Trump people are the same who think trans women are a threat to women
This is just a bandaid fix, but I‚Äôm so thankful for it  
God, this isn‚Äôt even hyperbole. This is straight reality.

I had two bagels for lunch and it was perfect.
Pretty sure that as a woman, I can make my own decisions about my feminism without a man helping me figure it out.

Fun thing about #RutgersUnite is it was the first half marathon I ever did and look how that turned out!
Oh, hey, I didn‚Äôt mention this yet, but I‚Äôm an ambassador for the 2017 #RutgersUnite Half Marathon! It‚Äôs one of my fave races! #bibchat  
Never understood why you wouldn‚Äôt use a paper towel instead of a paper napkin

Holy crap. Read the thread.  
Hey, fellow woman, maybe don't encourage men to come to an event/hangout using women in sports bras as the incentive.

If I week goes by and I haven't learned AT LEAST one new thing, I consider it a failure.  
Holy shit. My pharmacy was actually able to refill my 40mg/ml estradiol!

This shouldn't have to be a thing that's surprising.
This ad is so good, it's almost as if Pence did it on purpose.

The real winner of the #VPDebate was my body‚Äôs hydration. Had to sub water for alcohol since I‚Äôm not drinking this week. 64oz in 90 minutes
I‚Äôm so glad that shit show is over #VPDebate
The only time either candidate strongly stood out tonight was Kaine talking about women and abortion. #VPDebate
‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you trust women?‚Äù - Tim Kaine

ANSWER IT PENCE! #VPDebate
Damn, Kaine with a KO blow to Pence regarding abortion #VPDebate
This.  
‚ÄúI try to spend a little time on my knees every day.‚Äù - Mike Pence, the guy who HATES gays #VPDebate

If you think repeating the things Trump has said is an ‚Äúinsult-driven campaign‚Äù then maybe the problem is Trump #VPDebate
Kaine putting his finger up to silence Pence was amazing #VPDebate
Face swapping Kaine and Pence actually makes Pence look more normal #VPDebate  
To all immigrants to America, all I have to say is ‚Äúwelcome to the shit show.‚Äù #VPDebate
Please, go into detail about ‚Äúextreme vetting,‚Äù  . Please. #VPDebate
A4: Dealing with it right now. Raced a half too hard 3wks before goal marathon, didn‚Äôt adjust training for recovery after. #bibchat  
When Pence says ‚Äúrestore law and order,‚Äù what he means is ‚Äúlock up all the black people.‚Äù #VPDebate
Well, I mean, maybe we can let them speak when spoken to. We‚Äôll see. #VPDebate  
I was worried the #VPDebate was going to keep me up past my bedtime tonight, but this is completely unwatchable so maybe not
You forgot gays. #VPDebate  
Welp, this is already a disaster for everyone #VPDebate
A1: Trust your training and try to relax. Stick to your race plan. You were smarter when you made the plan than on race day. #bibchat  
Just remember, Mike Pence hates LGBT people and loves the KKK. #VPDebate
#VPDebate, #BibChat, and #DevDiscuss at the same time!  
#YoureTheWorst is super underrated. Really funny while also adding humanity to mental illness and taking it seriously

I can't possibly imagine caring less about VR. Just so not interesting to me. #GoogleEvent
Google Pixel looks like a really great phone and I would buy one if I used Android, but it's not exciting or interesting in any way
It'd be rad if Apple and Google stopped thinking I want to actually talk to my phone to do things.

Yes, I get the irony.
Took me a few commutes to get through this whole thing, but it's a fantastically silly read

Why bother trying to change the perception that you hate women. Might as well just go all in and double down on the misogynist vote.  
Holy shit! I hope everyone is okay!

Holy shit, commentators!   hasn‚Äôt been off the pace. She‚Äôs running exactly the steady pace she wants #Rio2016
Meanwhile back in NJ, I'm not looking forward to my run after this is over #Rio2016  
They act like   was dropped because she couldn‚Äôt hang. She‚Äôs one of the most strategic-for-the-long-haul runners there #Rio2016
The problem with watching marathons is you‚Äôre tense, nervous, and stressed for 2.5 hours instead of just a few seconds or minutes #Rio2016
Yeah,  ,  , and   are all looking great right now #Rio2016
That‚Äôs how she runs. She knows what she‚Äôs doing. #Rio2016  
Gotta be careful with a woman commentating on a running event, her uterus might fall out #Rio2016  
Hi  , some of us want to see every fucking moment of the marathon. Please split screen when showing other shit. #Rio2016
How did I get out front? Where am I? What am I doing?!  
Commentators talking about Desi, ‚ÄúI suspect she knows what she‚Äôs doing.‚Äù She knows exactly what she‚Äôs doing, dude. #Rio2016

Trump is literally laying the ground work to try to take this election by force. Literally that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs doing.  
I was just wondering about this while running today

That was such a weird 10,000 race. #Rio2016
There are so many women on the track and so much lapping, I can't even keep track of who is where. #womens10k #Rio2016

God, I‚Äôm so fucking tired of being told how to ‚Äúbe safe‚Äù while men get a pass for being the reason I need to be safe üñï
So if this is what #runchat is, telling women it‚Äôs their problem, I‚Äôm done with it. I won‚Äôt stand for that.  
I know first hand how men are when women aren‚Äôt in the room. Mostly either misogynists or cowards  
The ‚Äúconversations‚Äù should be telling men to call out their fellow men when they are misogynistic &amp; make light of it  
The ‚Äúconversations‚Äù are never directed at men to stand the fuck up and have the slightest bit of guts to fight it.  
The ‚Äúconversations‚Äù say in passing that we shouldn‚Äôt have to take these steps and then go ahead place onus on them  
These ‚Äúconversations‚Äù tell men it‚Äôs not for them to worry about and it‚Äôs women‚Äôs problem to deal with.  
Constantly telling us what to do to be safe is what is dangerous. It‚Äôs passing the accountability and onus to us.  
No. It‚Äôs not dangerous. Women already know safety tips because we live them every minute of every day.

As some have seen already, I am on the cover of the July issue of  . Events like #orlando are why saying yes was difficult
I'll say it. The GOP wants to see LGBTQ people not exist anymore by any means necessary.  
The people who are quick to point out that a shooter was Muslim are the same who are silent when it's a white man
Mars is probably a safer place for LGBTQ people to live than Earth  
How many members of the GOP will pretend to care about LGBTQ people and completely ignore the blood on their hands over the next few days?
And I just saw this. Fucking hell  
So many tweets about ‚úàÔ∏è to SFO this morning

The latest update to iTunes is more proof that iTunes is unfixable. Burn the whole thing down and build from scratch.
Notice how easy it was for the author to talk about vaginas in a gender-neutral way  
Even though today was a planned off day, I'm feeling guilty about not going for that run I decided I would do mid-day.
This egg "works in gay clubs," so he clearly knows more about being trans than actual trans ppl.Good thing he's here  
WTF is a vagina bone?

My vagina didn't come with one of those. Did I get ripped off?
Finally. This is a good update.

So psyched to see   on this list!!  
Some guy came out of his house to tell   to stop cowbelling for the #newport10k and we said no
Really bummed I'm not running the #newport10k right now, but this race ain't worth the pain of this blister
Can't believe it took them this long to figure out 9/11 was caused by trans ppl using the bathroom. Like, obviously  
I was supposed to run a 10k tomorrow, but these damn shoes fucked up my heels so badly I don't think I'm going to be able to
Some people care way too much about how others run. How cares as long as people are enjoying themselves?  
It feels great and my brain doesn't work without it #FastFriday  
Keep 'em coming, Obama  
If you're the one doing the talking, you're not "just trying to learn"
This guy is defining people by their genitals, but I'm offensive for saying 'fuck'  
I love how quick ppl are to separate between trans ppl who have and haven't had bottom surgery in terms of what rights they should have
I find it interesting that in the NYC area, people default to spelling my name wrong (Emilia), but everywhere else people get it right

Apparently, it's going to be the summer of trans women on sports magazine covers.
Oh, come the fuck on with this.
 
I'm sorry, but I just feel like people need to stop writing think pieces about what phrases women should and shouldn't say. If that's okay
Another reminder that even in NYC trans people are under attack

Another thing I'm missing about running right now is it gave me something else to tweet about
I describe what I did and why, any weird stuff/caveats, and provide testing instructions  
I guess it was only a matter of time before Snapchat added a blackface filter
"What's the difference between `trashable` and `garbageable`?"

My hack day project is a Slack bot that travels through time and posts to Tumblr.

Literally every part of that statement is true.
A room full of democrats just booed Obama? #DemDebate
gosh, The Force Awakens is just so fucking good
I really hate writing javascript
These are huge improvements  
Well,   wins brands  
It's Hack Day at   today which means my already non-sensical job gets even more non-sensical. Upping the Whimsey Factor to 11.
Before surgery, I weighed 142-148lbs depending the day. At the moment, I weigh 131lbs and still feel grossly fat. Thanks a lot, patriarchy
 is a non-profit startup tackling transgender healthcare cofounded by people who work at Tumblr, Amazon, and Etsy.

Sheesh.
Be sure you're aware of typical UTI symptoms then. Almost any trans woman will be able to tell you what these are  
Unfortunately, it seemed like I needed to take this week off from running and I'm really not okay with this.
Let's hope phone battery tech gets better by then because it's gonna suck to not be able to pay your way home  
Current status: cat scarf  
"It's much nicer yo-yoing around 135lbs than 145"

"Who knew your balls weighed 10lbs!"

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Well, after 14hrs straight of hacking away, we've reached the part of the day where I start a fight w/our deploy bot  
So Melissa McCarthy just said "Who knew Bruce Springsteen could get any cooler," but what about all her transphobia on Mike and Molly?
This problem would be a lot easier to solve if cis people didn't have genders
A room full of the entire  team and I scream "guys, I don't know how to fix gender."
Reviewing many pull requests today so I'll be taking many selfies  
The copy we just came up with for the   error page actually makes me hope the site breaks
Committing straight to master like it's my job
Ran 5 miles in 43 mins and felt great. First five miler since surgery and it was the best I've felt on a run so far!  
Neither the weather nor my vagina seem to want me to run today, but I really want to anyway
A good 30% of the 1,057 commits to the   repo must be me with the message 'fucking linter'
My year-old Apple Watch has been on my wrist for 16.5 hours and still has 59% battery. Would kill for life like this on my iPhone

Listen, men, I know you think you're being nice, but quit offering up your seat to me *just because I'm a woman.* I can stand just fine.
It's been nearly three months since the last time we've been to Disney World. Planning our next trip is long overdue
Slack text formatting is killing my Markdown skillz
Yeah, but like that's a lot of people to have a conversation with just so we can, you know, pee.  
I got Dos Toros for lunch and used self control to not eat the whole thing. It's like I don't even know me anymore.
So, how was your commute today?  
I was just that person who stopped the train doors from closing to get on. I feel nothing but shame. Society should cast me into the shadows
Peeing was fun while it lasted!  
The thing about having two full-time jobs is it really fucks you up when you're at one of them for 11 hours
I see they're going for the ol' Carolina Transphobia Twofer here  
Remember that time when I actually woke up to run in the morning and didn't have to go after work? That was great, but it wasn't today.
This is disgusting beyond what I have words for. Depression is serious and not something to make light of  
Trans person: Here's my opinion as a trans person 

Cis person: Well,we can't be letting you have your own ideas now.That would be insane!

Not sure if you're aware how bathrooms work, but pants are dropped in private, in a stall, where no one can see  
So, before being allowed in a women's room, I need to drop my pants and show you my genitals?  
Absolutely true  
My gender is 'aggressively other'
Fight or flight
We're having a LAN party at Tumblr so basically I'm going to be dying a whole lot tonight
I hate myself so I set a 5:45am alarm in the living room to make sure I get out of bed to run tomorrow
Well, I guess I should start working on my gap

Me: OH GOD WHY WOULD ANYONE WILLINGLY DO THIS?!
Pretty much. I've tried real hard to like one over the other and I just can't.  
It's been nine hours and my manicure is still intact so I guess that means I'm finally an adult
No one was supposed to know this!  
Most days, my job is just an IRL meme
I'm starting to be convinced that Tumblr was really just created for the intention of covertly making me gayer

Hi #runchat! I'm Amelia from Jersey City. Goal right now is to build up enough to start marathon training  
Ran 4.01 miles in 35 mins and felt alright. Today's run was a bit tough, but 4 miles!

Do cis people realize how much more productive and contributing to society we'd be if they didn't keeping fucking up gender (identity)?
Does gender come with any sort of PTO? I'd like to take a vacation next week
Also, this is a really intense thing to have to do just to be legally allowed to pee  
SO much the first four  
Ugh. I guess this has been a great week for transphobic terrorists who hate Gary Shandling and javascript
Oh no, I've encountered a gay berniebro
Cis people who follow me, liking/RTing my tweets doesn't make you an ally. You have to stand up &amp; fight anti-trans legislation in yr states.
Also, WTF is "dress as a trans woman?" How does a trans woman dress? Go on, I'm listening.  
Funny because attacking someone else is illegal regardless of how you're dressed  
Things GOP is okay with:
- Murdering children
- Talking about children's genitals

Things GOP is not okay with:
- Trans kids existing
Christ, I go out for one night and get drunk and North Carolina passes a law making it illegal for trans people to go to the bathroom
Somehow it came up in conversation with   and now I'm listening to New Found Glory's cover the the Never Ending Story theme
But I don't see anyone trying to ban children or cis people from private/gender-segregated spaces  
I literally cannot even with this woman  
This basically just reads like "well, literally everything is going to kill you"  
Unpopular opinion: Google Chrome is actually kind of a turd anymore (except for its dev tools)
Blows my mind that ppl like   think kids are forced to be trans. This NEVER happens, but trans kids ARE forced to NOT be trans
My favorite typos/autocorrect fails from   lately:

- falafel -&gt; gal gels

I agree with all of this 100%  
Ran 3.1 miles in 29 mins and felt good. Another 5k down. Not quite as good as last night's though.  
Things that are really hard:
- getting back to a 5:30 wake up after months off
- dilating immediately after running
A5: Almost never run with compression. I find it uncomfortable. #bibchat   
A4: I play it by ear. I like to try to do a recovery run though #bibchat  
A3: foam roller, trigger point ball, compression socks. #bibchat  
A2: I have a   after 100% of my runs. Other than that, I just eat/drink what I crave #bibchat  
A1: Not as much as I should.There are only so many hours in the day. I'm good at times, but not consistent. #bibchat  
Ran 3.1 miles in 28 mins and felt great. Already back up to 5k like it's nothing! Felt GREAT

I've finished marathons feeling better than I do after those two miles. oof.
I realized this morning that I've accidentally been doubling my estrogen for the last month. Oops.

Look, Ben, I know you used to be a brain surgeon, but can you stop using medical metaphors for everything? kthx #GOPDebate
Jeb! has done a great job derailing Trump tonight. #GOPDebate
If Trump thinks this is tough, just wait to see what Hilary does to him in a debate #GOPDebate
Hey  , these Best Buy ads on your site are destroying my CPU/memory
Why is Cruz‚Äôs mic still on? Why was it ever on? #GOPDebate
Trump got close to almost making sense for a second there and Twitter got real quiet. #GOPDebate
I prefer running sneaks!  
Margaret Thatcher. Yup. #GOPDebate
A GOP audience booing Trump might have been the best sound I‚Äôve ever heard #GOPDebate
Yes. This is literally what he is supporting. #GOPDebate   
If political correctness is killing people, I wonder what bigotry is doing then? #GOPDebate
Not sure Trump quite understands what the internet is or how it works. #GOPDebate
Carly Fiorina is talking about the US Gov being behind in technology. Has anyone checked up on HP recently? #GOPDebate
I see we‚Äôre only defining violence by Muslims as terrorism tonight. And these dildos are talking about keeping America safe. LOL #GOPDebate
I can assure you Rand Paul, Rubio has no allegiance to the left. He‚Äôs a textbook dildo‚Ä¶I mean Republican #GOPDebate
Why aren‚Äôt we asking these dildos about gun violence which kills a gazillion more Americans than anything they‚Äôre talking about? #GOPDebate
WTF is Carly Fiorina even talking about? No, seriously, someone translate this to reality for me #GOPDebate
Candidates keep saying Obama hasn‚Äôt kept us safe, but the real threat here is guns and police brutality. Two things they all love #GOPDebate
Has Trump ever actually defined ‚Äúgreat?‚Äù #GOPDebate
Trump says things that don‚Äôt even make sense and the crowd applauds. It‚Äôs not just Trump supporters that are scary, it‚Äôs the GOP #GOPDebate
Carly Fiorina talking about being tested. She‚Äôs failed literally everything she‚Äôs ever done in her career. #GOPDebate
Chris Christie talking about betrayal. LOL. I guess shutting down a bridge over a grudge doesn‚Äôt count as betraying New Jersey? #GOPDebate
Rand Paul didn‚Äôt sound like a complete dildo just now? Weird. #GOPDebate
It‚Äôd be great if instead of a bell, their mics instantly shut off the moment they hit the time limit #GOPDebate
Reince Priebus sounds like a dildo #GOPDebate
Did this commentator on CNN just call the #GOPDebate an ‚Äúhonest‚Äù discussion? LOL
I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôve got it in me to sit through the main #GOPDebate tonight

I don't get it, these people who say "this wouldn't have happened if these people had guns," are they suggesting shootouts in the streets?
A thing that scares me is somewhere there's a guy thinking "fuck, they stole my shooting idea"
Who's to say he hasn't already?  
When do we get to give up on humanity and put us all on a one-way trip into the sun?
Fire your congressman next election.  
Literally at the point now where before I tweet anything I check if there's been another shooting so as to not accidentally be an asshole

Got that backwards, buddy. A NO vote on Prop 1 PUTS MEN IN WOMEN'S bathrooms! #YesOnProp1 #HERO  
I hear you don't want men in the women's room. I don't either, but that's what'll happen if you don't let trans ppl in the right bathrooms
Apparently, ppl are mad b/c Obama is trying to make it easier for ppl to get a job and get their lives back on track

Ran 6.2 miles in 55 mins and felt great. Wonderfully blissful run this morning! The temperature was perfec

Ah! Found what I was looking for!  
There was an article written by a biologist not super long ago that totally debunked the idea of biological sex. Anyone have a link to it?
Chromosomes aren't even used to determine sex by biologists. Neither are genitals.

So there's that.

 
A person's gender = what they tell you it is.

Literally that simple.

 
As said by someone who truly doesn't understand trans people.  
I get sometimes you're working in a codebase with inconsistent formatting, but your method should at least be consistent within itself
Yes! Very, very important!  
I don't understand how people feel they are entitled to a platform. And if you get to openly complain about it, you're not being silenced.

I went to camp so long ago that fucking Jesus Christ was my counselor
Hack day has escalated

I love how all these anti-trans/LGBT type bills that keep popping up all have "privacy" or "freedom" in their names  
But will it be the right conversation?  
I'm constantly trying to type emoji using the   way. I'd be happy with that.  
Four days in a row of liking how I look? When did I enter the Twilight Zone?  
In other news, I'm taking ideas for cool/weird things to do to Tumblr that you'll never get to see

Before you dive into my mentions with your internalized cissexim and transphobia, maybe consider just not.
My name is Amelia, why would you think you should call me Mr Gapin?
None of you would even believe the call I just had to have with  . Unbelievable. At least the woman who helped me was very nice
Today‚Äôs been a great reminder that the entire world has been set up in a way that makes the lives of trans people as difficult as possible

Whoa. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to do with this, but I need to do something  
Let‚Äôs just say that two days after what happened to Shadi, I called two doctors to schedule consultations to get new genitals installed

Hey #bibchat! I'm Amelia from Jersey City! This was the view on my run yesterday morning

Applauded by cis people, not the trans community. That should tell you something.  
In Hollywood cis men win awards for pretending to be trans women.In IRL trans women get fired,beaten,murdered for actually being trans women
What a beautiful Monday morning!

Yup, No Fun Amelia the Man-Hater sucking the fun out of everything. Glad I'm just a joke.

Feeling very much recharged today after my run. A thousand times better than I did last night. Almost feel ready to take on the world again
I've run 4 of the last 5 days (and spin the day I didn't run). It's only been 16 miles, but this feels like a huge step forward right now

You don't have to like #CaitlynJenner, but if you don't think her identity is valid then you don't think mine is either.
You don't get to choose which trans people's identities are valid and which are not. You insult one of us, you insult us all.

To be fair, if you didn‚Äôt make our lives super difficult and shitty, a trans person wouldn‚Äôt be getting a courage award right now ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

My goal for society is one in which I can walk up to this chick and be like "hey are you trans too? Let's be friends!"

And what makes this even harder is this whole place is basically the marathon equivalent of Halloween Town from Nightmare Before Christmas
Ugh. People here are *too* nice. I don't know how to handle places where everyone is super nice and friendly
Running is so important to me that it's literally *the* reason I won't have gender confirmation surgery. Don't want to not able to run 4mos
I know this all sounds really dumb, but I worked harder for this marathon than any other to date &amp; running is the most important thing to me
Walking to the expo I changed my mind back to running for real, but my knee started hurting enough to kill that for good hence crying
It was not pretty and I'm clearly not handling this like an adult. Fuck.
After picking up my race packet I couldn't exit the expo fast enough before having a huge emotional breakdown tear-fest over not running
But what if I run this marathon tomorrow.
I love working for a place where I get to go ‚Äúholy fuck, that‚Äôs awesome‚Äù when new projects are announced

Seriously can‚Äôt remember the last time I‚Äôve had this much fun programming
I‚Äôve been hacking away at my hack day project for 9+ hours and it‚Äôs felt like 10 minutes. So into this right now.
How did my life get to a point where it‚Äôs going to be a fight with myself to *not* run a marathon? #runchat
Who‚Äôs going to make sure I don‚Äôt actually decide to run Grandma‚Äôs Marathon Saturday morning? I fear I‚Äôll get there and be like ‚Äúscrew it‚Äù
It‚Äôs Tumblr Hack Day!!!! My project is probably going to kick my ass.

On #NationalRunningDay, I'd like to share a piece I wrote last year about why I'm deeply in love with the marathon  
Now is probably a great time to remind everyone that I run an amazing Facebook group for transgender runners! Get at me if you want to join!
Trans people are hilarious,just ask my coworkers. I make jokes about being trans all the time without taking anyone down &amp;I‚Äôm a fucking riot
Honestly, I‚Äôm getting a good laugh out of all the comments about me here    
Hey Tumblr, welcome to your better blocking system. So much better that we changed its name from ‚ÄúIgno‚Ä¶  
I can‚Äôt figure out a clean way to write this code so now I‚Äôm just staring at my screen refusing to write the obvious but sloppy solution

I'm basically a raging bitch, but I'm always polite and kind.  
My leg muscles feel like an entire boy scout troop used them to earn their knot tying badges. What the heck, man? #runchat
Oh, and now Dr Drew is telling Caitlyn Jenner how to trans‚Ä¶while inconsistently gendering her.
Do you think Caitlyn Jenner gets fucked by   as much as I do? Do you think she‚Äôs been told estrogen is out of stock and she‚Äôs SOL too?
The only wrong way to be trans is to tell other trans people how to be trans.  
Turn on the TV and   is spouting transphobic bullshit on CNN. FUCK YOU YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT! GET ALL THE WAY FUCKED!
Literally exactly what I'm working on!  
Everything about this is wrong and disgusting and literally what it‚Äôs like every day for trans women   #CallMeCaitlyn

Hey, uh, if you care about me in even the slightest, can you do me a favor and *not* watch the Bruce Jenner interview? It‚Äôd mean a lot.

Got my hands on a fourth monitor for 8,540,832 pixels of awesomeness   Alright, the last day of the Dopey Challenge! The marathon! My favorite distance! And not just any marathon, but the 25th anniversary Walt Disney World Marathon!

### Pre-race

I did my best to get a good night‚Äôs sleep, but it did take me a little while to fall asleep. I think I finally ended up being out by like 8:45, maybe? With a 2:45am alarm set, I didn‚Äôt think this was too bad. Six hours is reasonably respectable for the circumstances.

Once the alarm when off, I got myself dressed and stuck with what I had planned to wear the night before. The weather was a little warmer, I think it was even over 40¬∫ when I woke up! It‚Äôs a miracle! Much warmer than the previous three days, for sure. 
My bus ride over was quick and uneventful. Going through security, I just hoped to not see the same transphobic guard from the half marathon. I, yet again, was wearing all my post-race clothing so my bag check bag was in my pocket, meaning I could go through the no-bag side. 
The Ohana crew was already starting to assemble at our meetup spot for our final hangout. As much as I was over waking up in the middle of the night, I was sad it was our last morning to hang out. While it was still cold out, it wasn‚Äôt nearly as bad as the days before. I was wearing a pair of tube socks with the toes cut out as throwaway arm warmers, but I had a pair of real arm warmers and gloves if I wanted them for the race. I knew it‚Äôd be warming up way past the point of needing either so I really didn‚Äôt want to wear them, but I did want gloves to start. Unfortunately, I hadn‚Äôt brought throwaway gloves, but my friend Matthew offered his up to me without missing a beat. I felt bad taking his gloves and tried to refuse, but he wasn‚Äôt having any of it. I especially felt bad because he was a bunch of corrals back and would be waiting to start in the cold for _much_ longer than me.

Before heading off to the start, Issac, one of my trans runner friends came over to say hi. He lives in NYC, but this was the first time we actually got to meet in meatspace. 
When it was time to head to the corrals, Nathan, Katherine, and I again made the long trek together. The walk from the staging area to the corrals is more than a half a mile long and kind of annoying when you‚Äôre cold, but at least it‚Äôs something to get your legs moving a bit.

We hopped into the A corral and found ourselves way closer to the front than we would have liked, but we wanted to be around other people to stay warm. The three of us hung out and mentally prepared ourselves for the final day of running. I just wanted to get moving.  ### Miles 0 - 5

When you‚Äôre running Dopey, you probably shouldn‚Äôt be in the very first mini-wave to start the marathon, but there we were. Not just A corral (where the three of us _did_ belong), but the first of the mini-waves they broke the corrals into (where we _did not_ belong). I did not want to get swept up in the start and end up going too fast.

Katherine and I started off together, but quickly lost Nathan. This was to be expected, though. Katherine was going for a course PR and Nathan was planning to run a bit slower. We kept the pace nice and manageable, but my legs never really felt like they were settling into it.

These first few miles are always a bit quiet and dark. Even though they‚Äôre along the same course as the half marathon, the half seems to have a little more excitement. I think it‚Äôs just because you have less ahead of you to stay focused on. There also seemed to be much less entertainment out here than normal. I guess it was just the cold. Or runDisney scaling back. I guess either is likely.

Oh, and the terrifying Mickey Mouse hot air balloon was nowhere to be found.

Coming around by the Ticket and Transportation Center, just before the 4th mile marker, Katherine spotted Twitter friend Christina who was exactly where she said she‚Äôd be. She didn‚Äôt see us, but we saw her and screamed her name until she heard us. It was nice to see a familiar face for a brief second.

Just after passing the 4th mile marker, I decided it would be a good time to pee since I had to go a bit and didn‚Äôt want to hold it all race. I told Katherine I probably wouldn't be able to catch her at the pace we running so we wished each other a good race and I peeled off to a porta potty.

Spoiler: That was the last I saw of Katherine.

I was on my own now! Pretty much the first time since the first half of the 5k.

As we came into the Magic Kingdom bus area and I lapped my watch for mile five, I knew it was time to try to reign in my pace and get things under control. My splits were a bit erratic already and I do better when I‚Äôm running more steady. 
### Miles 6 - 13.1

After passing the 5th mile marker, we turned towards the entrance of Magic Kingdom just like we did the day before. And it was, again, glorious. I just can‚Äôt get over how much this small change enhances the race. It‚Äôs just so magical to enter this way. 
Main Street USA was energetic as always and I soaked it all the way up. As I came around through Tomorrowland, I saw there was hardly any line for Buzz Lightyear so I snapped a quick photo with him. And then I snagged a photo with the White Rabbit, Tweedle Dee, and Tweedle Dum as we came along by Mad Tea Party.  I was pretty close to the front of the pack, relatively, so lines for photo stops were non-existent.

In New Fantasyland, I crabbed out with Sebastian, whom I‚Äôve never gotten a photo with before. And after coming through Fantasyland and Cinderella‚Äôs Castle, I also snapped a photo with Woody and Jessie in Frontierland.   
Just like that, we were coming around Splash and Thunder Mountains and making our way out of the park. Back to darkness (my old friend?).

The inter-kingdom trek between Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom is, to me, the hardest and worst part of the race. It feels looooong, mostly because it is, and it‚Äôs rather boring. You basically just countdown the miles until you get to Animal Kingdom.

I did grab some photos with Clarabelle Cow and the _Up_ gang, though, so that helped to pass about thirteen seconds of the time. I also passed some time on an out-and-back section by looking for Katherine as the course doubled on itself, but no dice. She, apparently, saw me though. Somehow, somewhere, I had gotten in front of her. No idea when that happened, but neither of us saw it happen.  My pace and splits had started to even out a lot more through this section of the race. I got more on track, but I was worried about how fast I was running. I was running roughly 8:20 miles here and didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have it in me to keep that. My legs didn‚Äôt feel great and hadn‚Äôt at all the entire race. I just never felt good at all. Plus, I was feeling like there might be a üí© situation later on. Neither my stomach nor my intestines felt amazing. Both had been feeling off since my first gel at mile six. I prepared myself to bonk later in the race and end up with a positive split. I‚Äôm just so bad at slowing down once I get moving.

As we approached Animal Kingdom there was just one animal out, a goat or sheep? I can‚Äôt remember now. I‚Äôm sure it was too cold for most of them, just like it was last year. Usually, there are a whole bunch, though.

Coming into Animal Kingdom, I got a quick photo with Rafiki and Timon and soaked up, what I think is, Disney World‚Äôs most beautiful park. Fight me on this, if you want, but I‚Äôm right. 
We passed the halfway mark with pretty much no fanfare at all. There was just a timing mat and a smaller 13.1 sign as we came through Asia. I was at 1:54:something, on track for a sub-4:00 finish.

Dinoland USA flew by and we were back out of the parks again. 
### Miles 13.1 to 20

This is the other portion of the race that people tend to not like. I sort of dread it each year knowing it‚Äôs a little boring, but it always ends up ticking right off like nothing. Through here, I just focus on getting to ESPN Wide World of Sports and then to that 20th mile marker.

Coming out of Animal Kingdom and around to the front of the park, I couldn‚Äôt help but notice how quiet and empty it felt this year. Usually, there is a pretty solid crowd cheering in front of the park, but not so much this year. Again, I‚Äôm chalking it up to the weather.

Speaking of the weather, it was warming up a bit and even getting a little warmer than I‚Äôd prefer for racing. Just by a couple of degrees, though. The sun was also up now so I popped my sunglasses on. This was the first year I‚Äôd brought sunglasses for the second half of the race and I‚Äôve always regretted not doing it before. I had tucked the arms under my Garmin and Apple Watch on my left wrist and, while it wasn‚Äôt super annoying having them there, it did feel good to have them on my head now.

I snapped my annual graveyard pic and then mostly continued to ESPN without anymore stops. I had picked my pace up slightly and was now running more like 8:15s. I still wasn‚Äôt feeling monster, though. 
Throughout the windy two miles of ESPN Wide World of Sports, I was sort of just over it. I was running well, but not feeling like it. I was tired and my legs were tired.

I got a photo with sporty Minnie Mouse, but it never showed up in my race photos so that‚Äôs disappointing. But I did get another photo with Joy and Sadness this year right before heading into the stadium for our lap around the baseball field. 
After passing the 20th mile marker, I knew it was just 10k left to go, which to me always feels manageable. For most marathons, part of my strategy is ‚Äújust get to mile twenty‚Äù and I was there.  
### Miles 21 - 26.2

Coming out of ESPN, I was starting to pick things up a bit. My last 10k was by far the fastest section of the race for me. I don‚Äôt know what it is about this course, but this has been fairly consistent for me at the Disney World Marathon.

I was feeling tired, but my legs were trucking and I was passing people left and right. Quite a few runners gave words of encouragement as I went by, ‚Äúget it, girl,‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôre crushing it,‚Äù etc. Even though my legs were tired, I felt like my form and everything was on-point and I had plenty of back kick.

After mile 21, all of my miles were sub-8:00...which was surprising. So, at this point, I had two things on my mind... 1) score a new course PR and 2) go sub 3:40 for another BQ. I knew I was in good shape for the first, but the second was going to be _close_.

We quickly approached my absolute least favorite quarter-ish mile of the course. Just before you get to the marker for mile 22, you go up an on/off ramp from one highway to another. It's probably the steepest hill of the race, which isn't really same much, tbh. BUT it's also banked so you're running uphill and lopsided. And while you're dealing with that on your oh-my-fucking-god-I'm-44-miles-deep-in-this-stupid-Dopey-crap legs, you've also got a Toy Story army man drill sergeant dude getting all drill sergeanty on your ass here. Every. Damn. Year. _"Run faster, private!"_ _"Get them knees up!"_ Etc. Etc. They're always way deep in character, but I'm rarely in the mindset for shenanigans at this point. Surprisingly, my legs powered through and I must have looked good enough that the he actually complimented me on my form and pace. And, let me just say, this was a lot better than the year he tried to make me drop and give him twenty.

Coming into the back of Hollywood Studios, I knew I was done with taking water and stopping for photos. From here on, it was just running and just high-energy sections of the course.

We came around Tower of Terror and some of the guests in the park were cheering, but most just seemed confused. 

While I really miss running through the Backlot Tour and Streets of America, getting to run down Sunset Blvd is a really great consolation. I love it! 
Then after a quick jaunt down Hollywood Blvd, we were out of Hollywood Studios and making out way over to the Crescent Lake resorts. This part of the race goes quickly, but can be a bit frustrating because of how narrow the course gets when you‚Äôre running behind Disney‚Äôs Boardwalk. But as I was coming down here, I heard my friend Jen scream ‚ÄúAMELIA I LOVE YOU!‚Äù I was SO confused at first. I was sort of flying at this point and in total end-of-race focus mode so I didn‚Äôt recognize her voice. I turned and looked and yelled back ‚ÄúI LOVE YOU TOO,‚Äù but it wasn‚Äôt until a few seconds later that I realized who I said I love you to. I thought I was just yelling at a stranger at first.

Coming over the bridge connecting Boardwalk to Yacht Club, I started looking out for Danielle. She spotted me real quick and from pretty far away so she had a nice bit of screaming my name as I approached. As I ran by, I just screamed ‚ÄúSANDLOT! SANDLOT! SANDLOT!‚Äù at her. This idea popped into my head early in the race and I had figured I‚Äôd forget by the time I saw her, but apparently, not.

I was fucking beat at this point. I knew I was inside two miles, but ooooooooof. Kill me. Despite that, my legs were still trucking with a mind of their own at sub-8:00 miles. In fact, I was actually speeding up. Mile 25 was a stupid 7:35, roughly PR half marathon pace, and was only second to...mile 26? WTF? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Entering Epcot‚Äôs World Showcase, I was down to less than a mile and a half. I just kept reminding myself of that and picturing myself on my running route at home and where I‚Äôd be with 1.5 miles left. Oh, and that poop thing I mentioned way back in the first half of the race? Yeah, I was uh...squeezing cheeks.

We crossed over the bridge to the France Pavilion and I lapped my watch and did some quick mental math. I‚Äôd have to trip and fall and stay down to miss a course PR at this point, but that BQ time was going to be...close. I just kept pushing and kept passing people. 

The countries ticked off, but the World Showcase felt empty a-fucking-f. To be fair, it wasn‚Äôt technically open yet so there weren‚Äôt a lot of people cheering, but there also weren't many runners around me here.

Passing by Mexico, I was in the homestretch now and knew it. The pain would be over soon. I came around the turn into Futureworld looking...really good? Like my form looks fantastic in this photo here. This was near the end of a 7:20 26th mile. The hell? 
Futureworld flew by as I kept focused on getting to that finish. As I came out of the park and made those last few turns before the finish line comes into view, I was keeping on the effort and still squeezing them cheeks. 
As I approached the finish line, I thought ‚Äúhmmm...I wonder if I can do another jumping finish?‚Äù I figured I‚Äôd at least give it a try. Just as I was crossing, I jumped up with all I could and barely left the ground...and then __ stuck the landing. My legs buckled a bit, but I was about to keep from going down.   It was over! 48.6 miles of running was done!

I crossed at 3:40:15 for a new course PR by over three minutes! Pretty amazing. I did miss a BQ by 16 seconds, but who can complain? Besides, I didn‚Äôt _need_ a BQ and it wouldn‚Äôt have been fast enough to actually matter anyway. 
### Post-race

After getting my medals and checked bag, I basically ran right to a porta potty and, you know, did what needed to be done.

I figured I should get at least _one_ post-race character photo so I got in line for Dopey...where I finally found Katherine! 
I got my photo, looked at the lines for other characters, and said ‚Äúfuck it.‚Äù I hopped on a bus and literally shivered violently the entire ride back. It was so bad the guy sitting next to me asked if I was okay and if I needed anything.

After getting back to the room, I took my time getting ready for the day. I did some Rapid Reboot recovery sleeving and...uh...pooped like four more times. To be honest, my GI was a complete fucking mess the entire day. Even after leaving the room, I wasn‚Äôt done needing to...go. I‚Äôve never had this kind of issue post-race before. I‚Äôve had photo finishes before where I thought I was going to shit my running shorts, but never have I been a mess all day. I even, ugh, fucking üí©üí®ed in Animal Kingdom. And, let me tell you, sharting in Disney World is not exactly ideal. I recommend against it.  
### Other crap?

I‚Äôm really happy with how this race went. Like, _really, really_ happy. I ran well and stayed strong. I ran another negative split, making for negative splits in six of my last seven marathons. There is just no way you can complain about that.

I was worried that actually training for Dopey this year was going to backfire on me, but it didn‚Äôt. I ran my fastest overall Dopey ever. Hell, it was also my fastest Goofy Challenge too!

Lastly, I think this was my favorite Walt Disney World Marathon course ever. This was my sixth time and I don't think the course has ever been exactly the same any of the years I've run it. Well, 2017. What can we say about you? You were not good. We all thought 2016 was pretty much the worst, but 2017, you found a way to top it. For most those of us who expected 2017 to be even worse than 2016, I think it lived up to nearly every nightmare we expected. In some ways, it was even much worse than expected. 

While 2017 felt like it was decades long and has probably aged us all at least that much, I do think there was a lot in 2017 that should give us hope, as long as you‚Äôre willing to see it.

However, this isn‚Äôt a post about why we should see those things and have hope after 2017. This is a post where I reflect on my _own_ life in the last year, as I try to do each year. For me, it‚Äôs important to take this moment as a way to re-center how I see and feel about things. I consider myself a realist in my outlook, but you can‚Äôt be a realist without taking moments from time to time to recalibrate.

Much like 2016, I‚Äôm stuck in this awkward position of trying to reconcile that my personal life this year was hardly anything I could complain about, despite our world increasingly becoming a hellscape of which there is no escape.

Also like 2016, this year started off with a wonderful trip to Disney World for the Dopey Challenge, my second. runDisney races are how the wife and I have started off six of the last seven years and 2018 will follow in that tradition. It‚Äôs just...fun! And, this year, I ran a really incredible marathon in Disney. I couldn‚Äôt have been happier with it. 
As for the rest of running, my goal for the year was to run a lot more races than I normally do. Typically, I only run a handful of races each year, but 2017 was supposed to be all about changing that. I‚Äôd have to say I succeeded with this. I ran three marathons, seven half marathons, a 10-miler, three 10ks, three 5-milers, and six 5ks. That‚Äôs 23 races!

Of those three marathons, the first was my fifth Disney World Marathon, the second was my redemption at Grandma‚Äôs Marathon, and the last was my third time doing my favorite marathon ever, the Chicago Marathon. 
Not only did I run those races, but I PRed the 5k (twice), the 10k, the 10-miler (sort of an automatic PR, but fuck it!), and the half marathon. Can‚Äôt really complain about that! Oh, and I ran my first international race! And not only were two of those three marathons Boston-qualifying times, but they‚Äôre three of my four fastest marathons since transitioning.

I did have a few small running ruts this year and some flirts with injury in the first half that kept me from doing even more, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm in a position to complain.

I‚Äôm finishing this year with 1,582 miles, a new PR by about 30 miles. And if I decide to brave the ice outside after posting this, it‚Äôll be 1,586 before 2017 is dead forever.

Going back to the beginning of the year, we all knew 2017 was going to be rough, but attending the Women‚Äôs March in Washington DC turned out to be an amazing way to get energized and ready to fight all year. Of course, it was a mixed experience for many people, but the overall experience of that weekend for me was fantastic. I spent two days with friends and feeling the love and support we all have to give each other. This is for sure something that stuck with me throughout the year. 

Speaking of love and support from friends, 2017 became the Year of Wine and Cheese parties. My friend Grace started having our group of friends over the weekend after the 2016 election  for wine and cheese and, throughout 2017, this became something we did more and more. Each party was more epic than the last, sometimes with twice as many cheeses as people. Each gathering was a lady bonding extravaganza of friendship and support that breathed fresh life into us all. In times like these, friendship is important. 
In addition to great friendships, our family grew this year too! We officially decided to adopt Nibbler, the stray cat we took in at the beginning of November 2016. After adopting him out twice, only to have him come back to us twice, we realized we were his forever home the whole time. We couldn‚Äôt bear to send him off to another home. Having four cats is...well, a thing. But our family is big, furry, and happy. I couldn‚Äôt be happier to have Nibbler with us forever.  

2017 was also a big year for traveling. In addition to the January Disney trip, I took two other weekend trips to Disney World. One for the runDisney Star Wars Dark Side Challenge in April and the other at the end of September with some of my former Tumblr coworkers. That last trip was a particularly amazing experience because I got to see Disney World through the eyes of a couple adults who were experiencing it for the first time. It was like being around the giddiest of children. 

Despite three trips to Disney, I found time for other trips. I also went to Chicago, Duluth, Montana, London, Berlin, Edinburgh, and Reykjavik.

Chicago is, of course, one of my favorite cities and I‚Äôm glad we were able to spend the weekend of Chicago Marathon there three years in a row. 
I really wish I had finished and posted my post about my Montana snowboarding trip in March. This was such an amazingly fun time with Tumblr friends and newly-made friends. I got to spend five days snowboarding in Big Sky and a day snowmobiling in Yellowstone. Yellowstone included seeing multiple geysers, only seeing the very end of Old Faithful because it turns out Old Faithful isn‚Äôt so faithful after all, flipping a snowmobile, and having a bison charge at me. Of course, there were also the beautiful landscapes, as well.  
My trip to Duluth was my second time going there for Grandma‚Äôs Marathon, but first actually running it. This time, I got to spend most of my weekend with my friend Sophie and hang out around a city I find surprisingly charming and lovely. This trip turned out to be the perfect way to mentally recover from being laid off literally the day before.

Finally, of course, there was that epic Europe trip. When people ask me which of the four cities I liked the most, London, Edinburgh, Berlin, or Reykjavik, I can‚Äôt answer. They were all just so amazing. This was my first time traveling abroad alone and also my first time backpacking on a trip. Both aspects turned out to better than I could have possibly imagined.  
Not forgetting about that little ‚Äúbeing laid off‚Äù bit, I truly see that as one of the best things that happened to me all year. Yes, I LOVEEEEEED working at Tumblr for two and a half of the nearly three years I worked there, but I knew the time had come to move on, for many reasons. I had started looking for a new job already, but being laid off not only gave me the push to really dig into that job search, but it also meant I got a really amazing severance package which made being laid off an oddly solid financial investment‚Äîand this a bad run-on sentence with two `but`s . Not to mention, I ended up getting a three-month summer vacation which enabled that Europe trip to even happen. 
And through my job search, I learned a lot about myself and my experience. I gained massive amounts of self-confidence in my skillset and ability to do well in technical interviews. Of my seven in-person interviews, ranging from 3.5 to 6 hours, I got two offers and reasonably thought three of the others went well enough that I might get an offer. I‚Äôd always feared technical interviews. Prior to this job search, I had only done three (two of which leading to jobs) and felt like I sort of sucked at them. Technical interviews made me fear ever losing my job or even just searching for a new job, in general. Looking like an idiot or having people think I‚Äôm an idiotic imposter is one of my biggest fears in life and going on engineering interviews digs deep down into that. But this stint of interviewing showed me I shouldn‚Äôt worry about it. I not only should have confidence in myself, but I shouldn‚Äôt fear being able to find a job in this industry.

Plus, in the end, I came out of the experience with a new job at Bitly that I really enjoy. I work with some great people and feel challenged every day. It feels like the right fit for me. 

That new confidence also helped me going into my second college speaking engagement with _slightly_ less fear. I was still terrified, as I hate speaking in front of people or having a spotlight put on my like that, but it went really well. My first speaking experience was to a very small group of students a couple years ago, but this one was to a packed house of around 200 students and faculty members at Shippensburg University, including their dean and president. It was also preceded by a panel about being LGBT in the workplace with some amazing other panelists who are doing great work. Not only did I feel like the talk went better than expected, it did so with some technical difficulties. I had agonized over a powerpoint presentation to provide some visuals and a skeleton for my talk. While the presentation was mostly a crutch for me to have my talking points and outline available, there were also some points in my talk that really relied on the visual aids. However, when the projector was giving issues, I had to improvise and do without visuals. Lucky for me, I was able to use this as little bit of additional comic relief throughout my presentation in a way that made for a better talk. 

Ugh, I wish I had written about that experience when it happened. üòï

And, of course, my friends Matthew and Sarah were amazing hosts while I was in Shippensburg. I‚Äôm so glad I said yes when Matthew approached me about this!

I also don‚Äôt want to forget about getting a firmer grasp on my mental health this year. I started at the very end of last year, but continued that into this year. I think I‚Äôm the most mentally healthy I‚Äôve ever been. This is perhaps one of the best things I did for myself all year. It‚Äôs enabled me to be stronger and more resilient.

What a busy year! That‚Äôs just the big stuff too, there were, of course, so many smaller everyday kind of things, as well! While I don‚Äôt know that any single year could ever touch the life-changing level that 2016 was for me, 2017 was another really big year for personal growth and experiences.

There were for sure negatives this year, like Hattie nearly losing her tail in a freak accident. However, as I look back on my year, the negatives have faded away and are totally eclipsed by all of these wonderful things. It‚Äôs something for me to be thankful for and not take for granted. As we all know, 2017 was a complete and utter hellshow, but it‚Äôs remembering and focusing on all of these good things that keeps me going and fighting another day. Without reflecting on all of the good I‚Äôve experienced, I‚Äôd have nothing to fight for and I‚Äôd burn out. That balance is very important to me.

I know 2018 will be, _at best_, an extremely challenging year for our country and the world, but who knows what it‚Äôll have in store for me. I don‚Äôt think I could say it better than I did last year:
> 2017 will, almost without a doubt, be worse than 2016, but we don‚Äôt have to lie down and accept that quietly. We can stand up and keep on fighting. 2017 may be even worse than 2016, but that doesn‚Äôt mean this has to be a thing we‚Äôll say every year going forward. We can put in the work to make this not being the darkest timeline, but just a dark spot in an otherwise brightening timeline. And along the way, we can accept that good and bad things can happen simultaneously. We can accept and enjoy the good while lamenting and fighting against the bad. Life and the world are weird like that and the balance between good and bad things isn‚Äôt a constant. It‚Äôs a pendulum that swings back and forth.

After nearly three months since being laid off from Tumblr, I‚Äôll be starting my new job this week. I‚Äôm pretty excited about it, but before I go into that, I thought I‚Äôd write a bit about what my time off and job hunt have been like. I‚Äôve been pretty quiet about this whole thing on social media compared to the way I am about most things, so there‚Äôs a bit to catch up on here. 
My _plan_ for my unemployed time was to take at least a few weeks, but probably closer to a month, before doing anything at all. I was going to decompress and relax. Maybe even, I don‚Äôt know, enjoy the time off????? I haven‚Äôt had more than two weeks off from working in about 14 years so I felt like I deserved to enjoy just a little bit of time.

After a few weeks, I was going to start applying for jobs and asking around for who might be working somewhere that‚Äôs hiring. But with six months of severance, I was going to take my time with things. 
The reality was much different than planned. I actually wrote a 3,000 word blog post going into a lot of detail about it, but I decided to scrap it for something a bit different.

While I wanted to take the time off before doing anything, I also wanted to at least deal with my inbox first. The layoffs at Yahoo (who owned Tumblr prior to being acquired by Verizon) weren‚Äôt exactly a secret, even before they officially happened. So a lot of recruiters blasted out emails to people they found on Linkedin with Tumblr/Yahoo listed as their employer.

At minimum, I wanted to reply to a few of the non-gross sounding recruiters so their messages weren‚Äôt just sitting there forever. In addition to this, I had one recruiter I had been working with for a little bit before I was laid off. I wasn‚Äôt looking to get out of Tumblr ASAP, but I had started looking. I just didn‚Äôt have a _strong_ motivation to get out because I loved Tumblr.

From here, things ramped up immediately. Before I even caught my breath, my schedule was filled with phone calls and tech screens at companies. This was in addition to trying to schedule plans with both friends I hadn‚Äôt seen in a while and former coworkers for catching up.

My schedule quickly became busier than when I was employed. I was on the go non-stop from waking up until late evening. It was exhausting, but also good. Any free time between scheduled stuff, I spent doing practice coding exercises online so I could be prepared for interviews.

Trying to schedule things was a whole new level of hell. Each company/recruiter would ask for 3-4 times I was available so they could schedule on their end, but there were points where I had a ton of things scheduled already and then had two or three companies I was waiting to hear back about, but had to hold multiple spots for until one was confirmed. A couple companies did make this easier, though, by using system that allows you to just pick a time from what they have available. This was super helpful! If your job entails scheduling with people, you should do this! 
My first five weeks of unemployment were the exact opposite of what I had planned for them to be. I could have decided to put all of this on hold, but I was interviewing with a few companies I wanted to work for, so I didn‚Äôt want to hold up those processes. Additionally, Tumblr/Yahoo wasn‚Äôt the only NYC tech company that had layoffs this summer. Etsy and SoundCloud, among others, also had layoffs. Typically, there are way more jobs in development than there are developers to fill them, but I knew there might be a bit more competition for the jobs I was looking for. 
If you work in tech, you can skip this section, but for those who don‚Äôt, I figured I‚Äôd give a quick little overview of what it‚Äôs like to interview as a developer. Note that none of this is an endorsement of the process; I think the tech interview process is incredibly flawed.

Things start off probably the way they do for a lot of other jobs. You‚Äôll have a call with a recruiter (or someone performing the role of a recruiter). This is just a quick screen where they ask a little about your work history and what you‚Äôre looking for, as well as tell you a bit about the role and the company. On one level, they‚Äôre just trying to get a quick feel for whether you might be a fit for their company and the role, but they‚Äôre also trying to sell you on working at their company. At a really small company, this might actually be with an engineer, but it‚Äôs separate from any of the technical interviewing.

And this is, of course, after any email or Linkedin correspondence you might have before. If you‚Äôre working with a third party recruiter, that conversation would also be before this call.

The second step could be one of two options, both are designed to suss out if you actually know how to code at all and to get a quick sense for whether or not you‚Äôre worth the time to bring in. This step could either be a take home coding exercise or a phone-based one. Some companies will give you a choice between the two, but most will just give you one or the other.

The phone-based exercise is typically you and an engineer on their end. The call might start out with a quick chat about their role, the role you‚Äôre interviewing for, and/or your past, but this is brief. Some interviews just get right into it. Your call is either via video chat or the phone, but will (almost) always have a shared screen for coding. The interviewer will ask you one or two questions and you‚Äôll work through how to solve them. Sometimes, you‚Äôre expected to write code that will run and produce the desired results. Other, you‚Äôll be writing actual code, but won‚Äôt have to actually run it. These calls are typically 45-60 minutes so it can be hard to solve the problem and produce bug-free code. Generally, you‚Äôre being evaluated on your approach to solving the problem and the efficiency of your solution. At the end, there is typically some time to ask questions about the company and the role.

Take home exercises are similar in idea, but a little different. Here, you‚Äôre given a problem or two to solve on your own time. You usually have a few days to a week. Then you submit your solution afterwards. In my experience, these are expected to take three or four hours, but I‚Äôve done some that take longer. You‚Äôll be expected to produce an actual working solution that is (relatively) bug-free. And because you have more time, you‚Äôre usually expected to write higher quality code than on a phone-based screen.

Between the two, I prefer the take home exercise and would opt for that when given the choice. They‚Äôre a little more involved and take longer, but I always feel like I can better show off my ability when someone isn‚Äôt actively watching me write code and I have a little bit of time to think. They‚Äôre also just wayyyyy less stressful, I think.

The final stage of a tech interview is the onsite portion. This can be between three and six hours and may or may not include lunch. Basically, it‚Äôs a long ass thing.

The onsite interview will consist of a number of different sessions. Anywhere from three to six, in my experience, but usually four. Each will be 45-60 minutes and with one or two interviewers (most of mine were with one). These sessions will include any mix of coding on an actual computer, writing code on a whiteboard, solving system architecture problems, having a sample of code you brought with you reviewed, reviewing a sample of code given to you, figuring out and fixing a breaking issue or code with a bug in it, and a more values-based subjective type of interview (what most non-technical interviews typically are). It‚Äôs common for multiple sessions to be of the coding on a whiteboard type. Here you‚Äôre typically evaluated on your approach to the problem and the efficiency of your solution.

The onsite portion of tech interviewing is exhausting and stressful. 
I went on a total of six onsite interviews since being laid off. The shortest was 3.5 hours and the longest was 6 hours. Two were 5.5 hours. üò¥üò¥üò¥ And the first five of them were within a three week period. For the most part, I thought they all went pretty well on my end. There was one company I was really excited for and thought I would love working at until the interview which made me lose all interest in wanting to work there.

If I‚Äôm remembering correctly, I did eight take home and phone screen evaluations with seven different companies (one company wanted me to do two üôÑ). Of those seven companies, all of them invited me in for onsite interviews. The seventh one, I canceled after accepting an offer, hence having done six and not seven.

Three of those eight were take home style evaluations. There was also a fourth that I started, but didn‚Äôt submit because of accepting an offer. For the most part, I actually sort of enjoyed working on these. They were fun little projects and they also gave me an opportunity to get more practice writing Go (the programming language I was teaching myself at the beginning of summer).

There were a few additional companies I talked to without actually having anything go anywhere. One didn‚Äôt seem to have any interest in pursuing things with me, which was fine by me because the person I talked to there sounded like a massive douche... (I didn‚Äôt literally hang up, but mentally, I was done with that)

The rest of the companies I spoke to seemed interested, but got caught up with scheduling and timing issues or ended up filling the role before I would have gone in anyway.

In addition to all of the above, I had one onsite interview with one company and a take home evaluation with another before being laid off. The onsite interview did not go well at all. I was totally out of practice and rusty on interview-type stuff (which is usually nothing like what a developer actually does day-to-day). It was my first technical interview in three years. I also had gotten a bad vibe from the company beforehand and wasn‚Äôt super excited for the interview so that may have played into my performance as well. 
In total, I got two offers. Because of the timing of the second one, I had about 3.5 hours to make a decision between the two. Company A had come the week before and was expiring. Company B, I was expecting immediately following the interview (I _knew_ I nailed it), but the timing made things really close.

Choosing between the two was agonizing. Even though I had three and a half hours to make the decision, I did find out the night before (a few hours after the interview) that I would be getting an offer from Company B. I just didn‚Äôt know how much it would be for. This started my decision-making process, but it was hard to really make a decision without having the offer in front of me.

Between the two companies, I was really excited about them both and knew I couldn‚Äôt go wrong with either. Company A is a very stable, but smaller company that is profitable. Company B is a small startup that hasn‚Äôt yet launched (they‚Äôre targeting later this year), but has funding and should be good with money for a while. Their product was something that looked great and I knew I would be very excited and passionate about working on.

Both companies offered me working in languages I wanted to work in. Both are Go, the language I most was hoping to work with, and Company A is also Python, which I‚Äôd like to finally learn anyway. I felt like I could make a big impact at either company, but Company B would allow me to really own what I was working on and drive a lot of it. It would likely be _much_ more challenging. Both companies came across as having awesome people that I‚Äôd love to work with.

So choosing suuuuuuucked. I was really back and forth on it. Luckily, they both were through the same third party recruiter so I was able to talk things through with her without her being biased over which direction I went. Danielle definitely made clear where she wanted me to go.

Company A was offering me more money, better healthcare that‚Äôs also trans-inclusive and 100% covered premiums, 401k (with employer match), commuter benefits and a better commute (literally one block from Tumblr HQ ü§£ü§£ü§£), a dog-friendly office (not that we have a dog, but I want to hang out with other people‚Äôs doggos!), and a few other small perks. Because Company B is a small startup, they couldn‚Äôt offer most of that and the offer was lower.

In the 3.5 hours I had, I asked Company B for more in the base salary, but they could only offer me a signing bonus making up the difference between the two offers. Of course, that only makes up the difference for my first year there. Between the two, Company A also offers a better work/life balance and no on-call rotation, while Company B isn‚Äôt at a stage to be able to offer that.

In the end, I had to make an actual adult decision. At 34, things like a 401k matter. If I was in my early 20s still, I would probably approach things differently and even be disappointed in myself for approaching this how I did, but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Even though I only had a little bit of time, I decided to at least rough estimate the true difference between the two offers. I estimated what it would cost me out of pocket to make up for the 401k, the health and commuter benefits, the commute itself, and the other differences. In the end, I would be coming out about even with what I was pocketing at Tumblr, at best‚Äîa salary I felt was no longer where I should be.

After agonizing, I made a decision. Despite the above, I chose Company B and went with the role that would be more challenging and the product I would get to have the most impact on. That was at 2:52pm, with 8 minutes until my call with Company A to tell them my decision.

At 2:55pm, Danielle asked me ‚Äúare you happy with your decision?‚Äù And, honestly, I couldn‚Äôt say yes. Something felt off. I wanted to be happy, but I wasn‚Äôt. I think in that moment, it really hit me the difference in what the work/life balance would be between the two and how much the benefits really mattered. I could have been fine with the work/life balance if it was only lower salary or worse benefits, but I couldn‚Äôt do it with both.

At 2:58pm, I messaged Danielle and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going with Company A. I think that‚Äôs the right decision.‚Äù Two minutes later, it was official!

So that was that! 
Yup, Bitly! The link shortening company. I‚Äôm pretty excited for it! I got a really good vibe from everyone there and it‚Äôll be nice to work for a company that is profitable. Plus, it‚Äôs the same short and easy commute as I had at Tumblr and just a block away so I can meet my favorite old coworkers for lunch. 
The company is small enough that I think I‚Äôll get to have a pretty solid impact, but also stable. While I am in a place in my career and financially that I could have taken a risky position at a startup without too much worry, I think it‚Äôll be nice to have have some stability in my workplace. As much as I loved Tumblr, it wasn‚Äôt really the most stable company to work for in the last two years because of Yahoo being up for sale and, eventually, selling to Verizon. And before Tumblr, I was at a company that made money, but had been acquired by a larger company and had been slowly but consistently changing with processes and such in flux for years.

I‚Äôm also excited to work in Go and Python. I‚Äôve really been loving Go and I‚Äôm surprised I‚Äôve gone this long without needing to learn Python. I think it‚Äôll be a good skill to have for my career.

Additionally, I‚Äôve been starting to realize just how bad it was the way I let Tumblr invade my whole life. I‚Äôve always been a very big proponent of keeping a good work/life balance and had never let myself stray from that. It‚Äôs one thing to have friends from work whom you hang out with after hours and on the weekends, for sure. It‚Äôs another thing when you let your life start to revolve around that whole world and you‚Äôre constantly checking Slack all the time. Your job shouldn‚Äôt be your life. I made that mistake with Tumblr. It became everything and sucked up so much of my life. I don‚Äôt want to do that again. I want to work at a place that I really enjoy being at, but that is only part of my life, not the entire thing. While _working_ after hours wasn‚Äôt a thing I did at Tumblr, I think Company B had a strong potential to try to suck me into doing stuff well beyond 40 hours/week. 
In the end, both of my offers came from companies I got in the door at because of the recruiter I was working with before being laid off. She‚Äôs, honestly, fantastic. She was super nice and really made me feel like she cared about finding me the _right_ fit. If anyone is looking for a job in tech in NYC, let me connect you with her!

Not everyone I worked with was like this, though. I worked with one recruiter who did just about everything he could to annoy me. I talked to a few companies through him and did one phone tech screen. That company wanted me to come in for an onsite interview, but that was the interview I canceled.

This recruiter constantly texted me about opportunities, which just like...no. Don‚Äôt do text me unless it‚Äôs urgent. And his texts were always like ‚Äúdo you have a few minutes to hop on a call?‚Äù Then the call would just be him telling me real quick about the company and asking me to email him some times I was free to schedule. Like, dude, just email me. Don‚Äôt text me. Don‚Äôt make me talk on the damn phone for something that‚Äôs _better_ emailed. Eventually, I had to ask him to stop texting me. In addition to those two strikes, he also didn‚Äôt really listen to me with the companies he was trying to set me up with. One of the companies, in particular, I told him wasn‚Äôt interesting to me. They seemed cool, but it wasn‚Äôt a product I had any interest in working on. He set up a call anyway. And then, it turned out the role wasn‚Äôt even a senior level even though I told him I was only looking for senior roles. Still, he kept pushing me to interview there anyway. He was clearly more interested in filling roles than he was with fitting the right people with the right roles.

I know recruiters make money by filling openings, but he made me feel like nothing more than a product he was trying to move. He was otherwise a nice guy and we talked about cats a bunch, but when it came to business, it felt totally cold and impersonal.

I had two companies I expected to offers from give me the same reasoning for not moving forward. They both said they liked me a lot and thought I might be a good fit, but not for the roles they were currently hiring for. They each said they wanted me to connected back with them in a few months. The first company really irked me with this. It should have been super obvious from the beginning that I wasn‚Äôt going to be a fit for the role they were hiring for. Nothing in the recruiter call or technical phone screen should have indicated my background was right for that role. They shouldn‚Äôt have even brought me in for an onsite interview. Instead, they wasted 5.5 hours of my time. During the process, they made no indication to me that they weren‚Äôt hiring for a role I thought I‚Äôd be a fit for.

One last thing to sort of mention here, it‚Äôs weird to be interviewing for a new job when you‚Äôre, for lack of a better term, notable. By notable, I mean, if you Google me, not only am I the only Amelia Gapin, but the results aren‚Äôt just like my blog and Twitter or the typical things you get when you search most people. Because of the magazine, there‚Äôs all this other stuff that comes up when you search me. If you go beyond the first couple pages of search results, you‚Äôll find a few other articles about me that aren‚Äôt related to the magazine. Some are other articles about me as a vocal trans athlete and some are about the startup I co-founded. Still, they‚Äôre things that likely stand out.

I always hate bringing up the magazine or doing anything that might come across as humble bragging or whatever it sounds like when you read this, but it was a thing. I expect companies and interviewers to Google people before interviewing them, but it‚Äôs weird when there‚Äôs actually something for them to find and all of it is just out there.

It came up in one interview when the CEO of the company mentioned he Googled me. He didn‚Äôt say it to particularly talk about the magazine, but instead to talk about what all of the results he found for me, in addition to the way I talk about things on my blog, say about me to him (it was a good thing). Still, it was weird. It‚Äôs one thing whe people read my blog or Twitter beforehand‚Äîat this point, everyone has some public-facing internet presence that can precede them. It‚Äôs another thing when there‚Äôs stuff _about_ you.

And besides the magazine itself, I‚Äôm also walking into a interview with someone who likely already knows I‚Äôm trans before I get there. This would be the case anyway thanks to my openness on my blog and my Twitter, but it‚Äôs definitely a thing to consider. It means I might basically be ‚Äúthe trans one‚Äù to them. Not necessarily in those words, but that‚Äôs the _thing_ about me that sticks out. I guess the good thing about this, however, is I likely have to worry less about getting a job offer and finding out my transness is going to be a thing there after starting. This would, in theory, have already played out.

ANYWAY, I‚Äôll stop throwing words at you now and wrap this up here. I start at Bitly on Wednesday and I‚Äôm excited for it. I‚Äôm not really ready for my summer vacation to end and I absolutely hit a point where I no longer want to ever work again, but I‚Äôm excited for my new job!

Berlin is, by far, one of my favorite cities on the planet. It‚Äôs just so damn good in so many ways. I‚Äôve been saying for years I want to move to Berlin and when shit goes to shit in the US, Berlin is where I want to go to.  I arrived in Berlin to Schonenfeld Airport in the early afternoon. I remember when I was in Berlin in 2012, the new airport was supposed to be open, but it was delayed and _still_ isn‚Äôt open yet. Anyway, I hopped on the train to the city and got off at Alexanderplatz. Google told me to transfer to another train to get to my Airbnb, but I decided it was a nice day out and I‚Äôd walk the mile or so instead, even with my heavy backpack. 
When I arrived at my Airbnb, my host‚Äôs cleaning lady let me in. The apartment was on the 21st floor and provided an amazing view of the city from both the kitchen and my room. My room was absolutely huge, much more than I needed for just myself. Since I was feeling pretty gross thanks to not showering before leaving Edinburgh, I took a quick shower before heading out for the afternoon. 
I didn‚Äôt actually end up meeting my host until the next morning after my run, but she turned out to be a sweet old German woman who had lived in East Berlin during the Cold War. She was very friendly and offered me breakfast every day and was eager to sit and talk with me. She also insisted on doing my laundry for me after I asked her how to work her washing machine‚Äîit was entirely in German and I can‚Äôt make heads or tails of it.

My Airbnb was very conveniently located in Mitte, within a reasonable walk from most things I wanted to do. It couldn‚Äôt have been much better. However, next time I‚Äôm in Berlin, I might stay in the more northern section of Mitte, closer to more of the nightlife.

Getting around Berlin, well at least Mitte, was pretty easy from memory so that was helpful. And the U-Bahn and S-Bahn are easy to navigate with Google Maps to tell you where to get on and off. 
I did three runs while in Berlin. When Danielle and I were in Berlin in 2012, we had plans to run in Tiergarten, but never ended up doing it because we were exhausted. I wasn‚Äôt going to let that happen this time. 
My first run was five miles along the river. A lot of cities have paths along their rivers, but the section of the Spree I was running along didn‚Äôt have one so I was running on the sidewalk next to the river. This left me with a lot of street crossings to contend with, but for the most part they were small enough to cross without having to stop. I ran just into the northern section of Tiergarten near the Reichstag and then turned around to head back. My legs were pretty exhausted for this run, but it was still an enjoyable. Mostly, I was just happy to be in Berlin and going for a run! 
My second run was supposed to be a morning nine-miler. Unfortunately, my clothes were...MIA. My host had taken them to wash as she said she would, but I guess they weren‚Äôt dry yet and I had no idea where they were. She also either wasn‚Äôt home or wasn‚Äôt awake when I woke up. So I just went about the rest of my day with hopes of fitting my run in later. And if not, I had a little flexibility to move things around for the next few days. 
I ended up squeezing it in later that evening. I was debating if I‚Äôd have time to do it before it got dark and how safe it‚Äôd be if I didn‚Äôt finish before the sun was down. My tour guide from a tour earlier that day said it would still be very safe for me to run even if it was dark so I decided to go for it. I quickly changed and took off towards Tiergarten. Once I got there, I felt right at home along its paths. It was the perfect place to run. Despite being dusk, there were _tons_ of other runners out. It was glorious and my legs were feeling amazing. I was crushing mile after mile and looping all over the park. I was feeling so good I decided to throw a tenth mile in before finishing up. This run literally couldn‚Äôt have been better and I finished up before it was completely dark out. Wins all around! 
The next morning, less than twelve hours later, I woke up and knocked out my third Berlin run. This was a simple four-miler that just looped a bit into Tiergarten and then back to my Airbnb.  Food is one of my favorite things in Berlin. There‚Äôs just so much good stuff to eat!

One of my main goals was making sure I had currywurst. The best I had was at Dom Curry, but I also had it a couple of other times while walking around the city. Yum yum! 
The fanciest meal I had in Berlin was at Lebensmittel in Mitte. This is a delicious German restaurant with a 9.2 rating on Foursquare. This wasn‚Äôt on my list before going to the city, but I had trouble finding the place I was trying to find one night and ended up picking another one on Foursquare nearby. Unfortunately, Foursquare didn‚Äôt tell me you need to have a reservation here, but they were nice enough to sit me at a table outside anyway. The menu was all in German, but I was able to make enough sense of it to order my meal and a beer. It was fantastic! Highly recommended. I followed this up with ice cream from Bandy Brooks on my walk back to the Airbnb. 
The morning that I couldn‚Äôt run because of my MIA clothes, I decided to take a long walk to find Bonanza Roastery. It‚Äôs a coffee roastery and is most excellent!. I stayed for a couple cappuccinos and a pastry for breakfast. Bonanza has a great atmosphere and they require people sitting with laptops to only be at certain tables so as to make sure there are still tables for other people.  A repeat restaurant I hit up from when I was in Berlin in 2012 was Chipps. This was our favorite place on that trip so I wanted to come back for breakfast one day. It was as good as I remember! And it‚Äôs in a convenient location to start off your sightseeing day. 
On my last day in Berlin, I went a bit overboard trying to hit up some places before leaving. I had lunch at Shiso Burger and ordered the bulgogi burger. It was üëåüëè. From there, I went around the corner to The Barn for a coffee and then continued walking around. I walked over to Zeitgeist f√ºr Brot for a coffee cake with pie filling. It was so fucking good! And then from there I grabbed another coffee from Five Elephant because it looked cool when I walked by, but it turned out to not be that great in reality. Can‚Äôt win them all, I guess. My last stop before heading off to the airport was at Rausch Schokoladenhaus for some chocolate.   
Going back to my first night in Berlin for a second, I went on a beer tasting tour. Unlike the pub crawl in Edinburgh, this was much more about actually _tasting_ beer and learning about the history of beer in Germany. We started at Weihenstephaner Berlin which is a restaurant run by the world‚Äôs oldest brewery still in existence. We sampled a few different brews there before moving on to Brauhaus Lemke. Part of the tour also included buying some beers to walk around the streets with, as that‚Äôs legal in Germany üçªüö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§§. We ended at Kaschk, a fantastic craft beer bar which was had also been recommended to me before my trip.

During the tour, I made friends with an Australian couple who was in the middle of a four week European trip. They were great company to have while drinking.    

Like the rest of my trip, I packed my time in Berlin.

In 2012, we took an amazing free walking tour from SANDEMANs that we loved. Our tour guide, Sam Noble, was incredibly passionate and knowledgeable and you could tell he just straight-up lived for giving tours and sharing history. At the time, he was working on his PhD at Humboldt University in Berlin. Fast forward to a couple weeks before this trip and I found out he was still giving tours and listed his Instagram on his bio on the SANDEMANs site. I decided to be a little creepy and send him a message asking him if I could request to be in his tour group. He was kind enough to send me his schedule and I made sure to book for when he was doing the tour. 
To my delight, he was as great as he was five years ago. His tour had evolved a little, but it was still superb. He was no longer pursuing his PhD and is now giving tours full time so he really puts his all into it. It was such a great time! This tour included Pariser Platz and Brandenburg Gate, the outside portion of the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, F√ºhrerbunker, Bundersministerium dear Finanzen (the old Luftwaffe HQ), the Berlin Wall Monument, Checkpoint Charlie, Konzerthaus Berlin, Franz√∂sischer Dom, Bebelplatz, and The Memorial to the Book Burning of 1933. And, of course, more history than you could possibly hope to remember.  I also did the SANDEMANs Third Reich tour with Theo. This tour was an interesting deeper dive into some of the WWII portions of the free tour. Theo was good, but not as good as Sam. This tour included some of the same stops as the free tour, but also Tiergarten, the outside of the Reichstag, the Memorial to the Sinti and Roma Victims of National Socialism, Soviet War Memorial, Memorial to Homosexuals Persecuted Under Nazism, Potsdamer Platz, Stiftung Neue Synagoge Berlin, and J√ºdischer Friedhof Berlin-Mitte.

The final guided tour I did while in Berlin was a tour to Sachsenhausen concentration camp in Oranienburg. This was, obviously, a somber and heavy tour, but it felt necessary to squeeze it into my trip. Our guide, Rob McCracken, took us on the train to Oranienburg and then on the same walk from the train station the prisoners of Sachsenhausen would have been forced on. 
The tour was extremely well done and Rob did a great job of telling the history‚Äîa lot of which I had zero idea about‚Äîand also going deep into the societal, political, mental, and emotional aspects of what happened at the concentration camp and in the town around it. He constantly posed the question of what the German people really knew about what was happening at the time. And he repeatedly urged us to think hard about what each of us would have truly done at the time. It‚Äôs easy to look back on something like this and say what you‚Äôd have done, but it takes a lot to think critically about yourself and what you would have _actually_ done when faced with that same situation. This should hit any American who takes this tour hard right now. 
Despite being emotionally intense, I‚Äôm glad I went and I‚Äôm even more glad I did so as part of a tour. The tour added a lot more than I would have gotten doing this on my own. I learned more and got a much greater sense of context in which all of the atrocities here happened. At the same time, the tour also allowed me to experience everything with other people and to have a little reprieve from the gravity of it all. On the tour, I made friends with woman from DC whom I chatted with the entire time. I don‚Äôt want to say this dulled impact at all, but it helped to give frequent and well needed emotional breaks. 
I took a lot of photos while at Sachsenhausen, which is something I felt a bit weird about. It‚Äôs one of those things where you want be respectful and you don‚Äôt want to make light of anything. But on the other hand, it‚Äôs something you _need_ to remember. It‚Äôs something no one should ever be able to forget. For me, it felt important to have those photos in my phone‚Äôs camera roll. Not because I‚Äôd purposely go back and look for them, but because they should be there when I scroll back looking at other photos. They should be there to be stumbled upon as a reminder. For me, taking photos was a way to take it all with me. 
Aside from my tours, I did a lot of exploration on my own. I spent some time walking around Mitte and enjoying the street art and walking through Haus Schwarzenberg and Hackenscher Markt. I also walked around Michaelkirchplatz and Kreuzberg on my way back from Bonanza Roastery.     
After the free walking tour, I went back to the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe and actually went down into the memorial. I didn‚Äôt even know about this part of it when we were in Berlin in 2012. This was, by far, the most emotional part of my trip. This memorial focused very closely on the Jews who were murdered. One room had parts of letters and postcards sent doing the Holocaust. Most of them were little more than recovered fragments. Few were full letters. I cried while reading many of them. This room in particular, to me, was the most real of everything in Berlin. It was the most personal and put more of a human face on Holocaust then even Sachsenhausen did. It was more than a gut punch. It was a pummeling. 
The next room told the story of more than a dozen families. Each family had a section talking about where they were from, the members of the family, what they did, and other personal stories. It then went on to detail what happened to each member of the family during the Holocaust. This was another really tough section to get through.

From there, I decided to keep things heavy for a bit and went over to the Topography of Terror. In 2012, this was one of our favorite parts of Berlin. By favorite, I mean it‚Äôs very well done and we learned a lot from it. It‚Äôs obviously not fun, but it‚Äôs a really great museum to spend some time at.  

As I‚Äôve mentioned, I really love Berlin. There is a lot of great food to eat, a lot to see, and a lot to experience. It‚Äôs the kind of city I could come back to every year. My only real complaint about Berlin is that Germans don‚Äôt serve tap water. It‚Äôs harder to get water than it is beer in Berlin. When you go out to eat, you have to order bottled water and if you ask for tap water, they won‚Äôt give it to you.  

My time in Berlin was incredibly surreal, as this was during the height of what was happening in Charlottesville. Being in Germany and visiting the places I did while white nationalists and nazis were holding rallies in America was a strange experience. But the thing about Germany is they‚Äôve dealt with their past. They don‚Äôt pretend it wasn‚Äôt a problem and they learn from it. Learning from it is a deeply ingrained part of their culture and education. Rather than try to forget it, they keep reminders of it out in the open. This is something America still has not done with racism and slavery. We need to deal with our past the way Germany has. Everything happening in our country now is because we haven‚Äôt dealt with it and refuse to.  Below are my check-ins on Swarm. Some of them aren‚Äôt places I went into, but instead were just places I was at or walked by. Some places I was just stealing wifi or using a bathroom. And some, I checked in multiple times as I passed them more than once.     
Unlike London, this was my first time in Edinburgh. I didn‚Äôt know a lot about the city before this trip, but I‚Äôd always heard amazing things about it.

One thing I definitely didn‚Äôt know was that during August there is a huge (like _really_ huge) arts festival called Fringe. I had never even heard of it before my trip and only found out what it was the day before leaving London to head up to Edinburgh. What I found out after getting there was that Fringe is absolutely wild and intense. There are constantly dozens and dozens of shows happening at any moment and in all kinds of venues, many of which are makeshift venues like coffee shop basements and restaurants. And the shows are all over the map, they are musicals, improv, standup, poetry, comedy, one-person shows. All kinds of stuff! Fucking wild, I tell you! 
I arrived by train after 10pm and was exhausted. I had made the most of the day in London before getting on the train and was ready to go to bed. Unfortunately, it took me a little while to find my Airbnb. It was very conveniently located in Old Town, but it was just down a weird two level street that I totally didn‚Äôt understand at all. 
When I got to my Airbnb, my host was hanging out in the kitchen with one of the other guests, a German woman from Berlin named Claudia. She really wanted to go out and see some live music and have a beer. The two of them convinced me to go with them and off we went. I didn‚Äôt want to stay out long, but I figured it‚Äôd be a nice way to experience nightlife stuff, especially since my time in Edinburgh was limited.

We hit up a music venue with a Scottish ska band playing (yeah, ska) and grabbed some beers. From there, we went over to a standup show around the corner. This was a man and a woman each doing sets. The woman, Megan Shandley, was very funny. The guy was also funny until he made a transphobic joke and then I over him. 
Getting around Edinburgh was very easy on foot. Everything I wanted to do was walking distance from my Airbnb. And it‚Äôs a very beautiful and old city to walk around so it was perfect.

I only had two full days in Edinburgh (aside from the unplanned late night my first night there). Had I known about Fringe, I would have probably wanted to stay a full week. At least. There were dozens of shows I wanted to see, but I could only do so many in my limited time there.

My Airbnb was kinda not amazing. I mean, it was located in a very good location for seeing stuff and the host was really nice, but it felt a bit dirty and the apartment reeked¬†of a place where smokers lived for years and years. It served its purpose though.  I had two runs planned for Edinburgh, but thanks to being out late the night before, I missed the first one. Luckily, that was just a four-miler so it wasn‚Äôt too big of a deal. And this was pretty much the only planned run I entirely missed without making up throughout my whole trip.

The second planned run for Edinburgh was the one I was most worried about during the trip because it was a long run of 15 miles. I knew I had to get it done, though, so I made sure nothing stopped me. The day before, I went on Strava and joined an Edinburgh running group for women and asked if anyone would be interested in making a new friend and running with me. To my delight, someone actually did! I was really excited for this!

We met up for an afternoon long run. Edite and I ran about 11 of my 15 miles together. We started around Holyrood Park and ran around Arthur‚Äôs Seat while climbing the tough hill there. Then we made our way down to the beach, where I would have never thought to go on my own. It was a nice mix of scenery. After heading back from the beach, we made our way around another park before we split ways. I finished up with a couple laps around the park to round out my 15 while trying _really_¬†hard not to shit my pants because my body decided it HAD to üí© and this was going to be non-negotiable. 
Overall, it was a really nice run besides the poop stuff and I was so happy to have a made a new friend for it!  I think out of all the places on my trip, I had the most places to eat saved in Foursquare for Edinburgh. There were so many restaurants, pubs, and coffee shops I wanted to try. 
My first real meal was breakfast at Hemma. It was superb and just what I needed after my hike of Arthur's Seat. The food was great and so was the atmosphere. For an afternoon snack, I stopped at Shakeaway and got an amazing milkshake to enjoy while walking around the city. I followed that up with tea and a sandwich and scone from Forsythe's Tea Room. The tea was good, but the food was pretty meh. To be honest, the experience was a little too kitschy old Scottish grandma for me. For dinner, I had a burger and fries from The Holyrood 9A and washed it down with a delicious beer.  The next morning, I started my day off with coffee and avocado toast from Brew Lab Coffee.

That evening I did a pub crawl and mostly just had a random sampling of bits of food throughout. The pub crawl was fun, though. I made some new friends and drank a ton of beer. I think we went to six pubs and nightclubs. Each one gave us a free shot and then had drink specials. By the end of the night, I was _quite_ drunk. So much so that I was still drunk when I woke up the next morning for my flight to Berlin. Awesome. LOL.

The crawl started at The Inn on the Mile and then we went to Pilgram Bar, The Whistle Stop Barber Shop, Frankenstein, Sneaky Pete's, and The Hive. Frankenstein was a bit more wild and crazy than I'm into these days, but the karaoke was at least entertaining to watch. The Hive and Sneaky Pete's were more like nightclubs which is definitely not my thing, but I still had a good time dancing with my new friends and having some really interesting political conversations with people from all over there place. The Pilgrim Bar and Whistle Stop were both more my speed, though. I'd definitely go back to those places.  

As I mentioned above, hit up a standup show my first night. The show was at Just the Tonic in one of their smaller rooms in the back. It honestly was just a cave, hence its name, The Cave. It was kinda neat though! The ska band I saw right before was at Stramash which is basically next door.

The morning of my first full day in Edinburgh, I slept in much later than planned. This was thanks to my late night. I had planned to run up Arthur's Seat. However, that plan was made before I actually knew what Arthur's Seat really was. It's a very old dormant volcano! I ended up hiking up it instead and, to be honest, I'm glad I didn't try to run. I don't think I would have made it. There were some people I saw who did run up, but it was wet from the rain the night before and extremely¬†slippery. Definitely didn't feel like running would have been safe. Just hiking it felt super sketchy. On my way done, I chatted it up with an older couple. The woman lived in the UK for the last 30 years, but was originally from the US. She ended up being great company for the hike back down. The view from the top was truly beautiful, though! And I was also lucky enough to get up and down just before the crowds started coming out.
 
While I missed my run, the hike absolutely felt like it more than made up for the four miles I had planned.   
Next up for the day was the free SANDEMANs walking tour. This was a fantastic tour of mostly Old Town, including Grassmarket, Greyfriars Kirkyard, Flodden Wall, and a bunch of other stops. I learned a ton about the history of Scotland and Edinburgh. The tour guide also pointed out some of the graves in Greyfriars Kirkyard that JK Rowling used as inspiration for Harry Potter. He pointed out the inspirations for Hogwarts as well. One thing the tour guides had been asked to stop doing was taking people to the grave of Tom Riddell, but he had no problem telling us where to find it after the tour.    

From the end of the tour, I made my way down to New Town to explore on my own. On my walk over that way, I walked around Edinburgh Castle and stopped for a few minutes to watch a street performer playing songs for a small crowd. He asked where I was from and I replied that I was from New York (easier than saying Jersey City). From there, he went into two great anti-Trump ballads for me. This was a recurring theme from my every city of my trip, Trump and the USA are a terrifying af joke.

I walked around West End and Multrees Walk. I also went up into the Scott Monument. This was really rad, but also a little scary because of how tight and steep the spiral staircases were. There was only one way up and down and it got a bit crowded at points where it was hard to pass people without being afraid you'd slip and tumble all the way down. Still, the views were great and every time I thought I was all the way up, there was another staircase to discover to go up even higher.  After this, I was handed a flier for a small improv show happening nearby. I decided to check it out since I had some extra time. And I'll just say this, it was bad! It was three dudes who were not good at improv at all, but it was at least entertainingly bad until they made¬†three transphobic jokes in rapid succession.

Last up for the day was the SANDEMANs Dark Side Tour. This was a exploration of Edinburgh's more gruesome past including murder, people being buried alive and coming back from the dead, grave robbing, torture, witches, hangings, body stealing, people being crushed to death by falling coffins, and all kinds of other morbid stuff. Personally, I loved the tour and thought our guide, Sarah, was amazing. She was animated and passionate and an amazing storyteller. This tour also made for a great companion to the free tour earlier in the day as it went into more detail for¬†a few things that were only briefly mentioned.

I started my second day off with a nice long walk to Summerhall. On the way, a guy was out front of a cafe handing out fliers for his poetry reading, and because I wanted to take as best advantage of Fringe as I could, I stopped in to check it out. Unlike the improv show the day before, this was really good. The reading was in the basement of the cafe with just a handful of people, nice and intimate. The poet's name was Ben Ray and not only was his poetry good, but his reading of it was light and entertaining.

From the poetry reading, I made my way to the start of another guided tour. This was a tour of Edinburgh Castle. The tour included the obvious history and a nice overview of things at the castle. I absolutely got more out of my time in the castle than I would have without a guided tour. Afterwards, I hung around a bit to explore before heading out to go meet my running partner for our run.    After my run, but before the pub crawl, I stopped in for one more show. This was again at The Caves at Just the Tonic. This show was called Tracey Tracey and was a one woman tragi-comedy¬†by Nicola Cross. This show was super weird, but highly entertaining with just a bit of crowd interaction. I enjoyed it a lot. 
For just two days in the city, I feel like I really packed a lot in. I was non-stop running from thing to thing and on the go without much rest. I really wish I had had more time to go to more Fringe shows. I ended the weekend there with probably three dozen fliers for shows, a good half of which I'd have liked to have seen.

I will absolutely have to go back for longer some tine in the future.

Below are my check-ins on Swarm. Some of them aren‚Äôt places I went _into_, but instead were just places I was at or walked by. Some places I was just stealing wifi or using a bathroom. And some, I checked in multiple times as I passed them more than once.   When I first went to London in 2009, I really loved it. I‚Äôve been wanting to go back ever since so it was at the top of my list of destinations for this trip. 
I stayed in London for two full days and two half days (one was like 3/4 of a day, tbh). It was three nights in my Airbnb in Pimlico. The Airbnb was a really nice place, definitely the nicest of my whole trip. The owner lived there and rented out three rooms on Airbnb.

Upon entering for the first time, I was immediately greeted by an incredibly friendly cat named Nala (not sure on the spelling). She came right up to me and immediately started rubbing on me and crying for attention. I knew this would be a good place to stay based solely on this cat. There was also a second cat that was a little less outgoing and needy. Nala, though, oh boy did Nala crave attention. She‚Äôd run up in front of you and block you from walking through the house until you pet her. 
My room was a small one that was actually _under_ the sidewalk. Though, this was the same level with the kitchen and the walk out to the backyard so it wasn‚Äôt really a basement room. The room was more than fine for my needs, though.

Also staying at the Airbnb was an Australian woman named Greta. She was there my entire stay and we had a few really nice conversations over tea while relaxing at the end of the day. Incidentally, we also overlapped time while in Reykjavik, but we didn‚Äôt end up meeting up‚Äîthough, we did connect on Facebook.

The location of the Airbnb was pretty decent and relatively central to a lot of things in London, but did require taking the London Underground to get to a lot of places. Though, that really was a non-issue as the Underground is fantastic and makes NYC‚Äôs MTA look like ameteur hour. The Underground is clean, efficient, and runs frequently. 
While in London, I did two runs, which is what I had on the schedule, but they were for 7 and 5 miles and I, instead, did two 10k runs and shifted the days. It worked out in the end, but not exactly as planned.

The first run was along the River Thames from Pimlico up to Millenium Bridge, across the bridge, and then back. It was great weather for a run and there were a ton of other runners out. _Many_¬†runners were out with backpacks while I was in London. It seems like run commuting is very popular there!  My second run was a bit more of a sloppier route. I had mapped something out, but it was a bit hard to follow based on memory so I just when with the gist of the idea. This run was through St James Park, around the lake, past Buckingham Palace, over to Hyde Park, around the lake there, and then back. This run was a little earlier in the AM so it was a nice peaceful route without many tourists out.  While the England isn‚Äôt exactly known for its food, I do love me some fish and chips. So right after I dropped my bag off at my Airbnb, I set out for fish and chips. I ended up at The Sherlock Holmes which was near the touristy area in Westminster, but it seemed like there were a few locals there and it wasn‚Äôt a complete tourist trap of a place. The fish and chips were good and so was the beer!

My second day, I had lunch at Itsu, which is like a sushi and noodle chain ‚Äúfast food‚Äù type place. My soup was very flavorful! For dinner, I had curry at the Brick Lane Brasserie. There was no way I wasn‚Äôt going to get curry on Brick Lane! Because I had idea which of the many places there to pick and they all had similar ratings, I just picked one at random. It also helped that a tour guide I had earlier in the day said ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt matter, they‚Äôre all good. You can‚Äôt go wrong.‚Äù My food was spicy and delicious! I finished it off with hot chocolate from Dark Sugars, right up the block.  Breakfast the next day was a pulled pork and mac and cheese amazingness from Borough Market. I followed that up with a doughnut from another stand and then a late morning beer at the Southwark Tavern. The best part of this morning was spending some time with my friend and former Tumblr coworker, Malika!  

For dinner, I had a delicious burger and fries from CASK Pub and Kitchen.

On my last morning in London, I had one goal and that was to make sure I didn‚Äôt leave the city without having a proper pie. Another former Tumblr coworker (who is English) had been stressing to me how good the pies are so I had to do it. I went back to Borough Market and hit up Pieminister for a steak pie. It was out of this world good. I mean, fuck, that thing was good. Pies are good. 
Lunch was at The Fence with Malika and one of her friends from when she studied abroad in London. We ate in this cute little shed in the backyard there. It was pretty neat!

For dinner, I just had a burrito from Benito‚Äôs Hat in King‚Äôs Cross Station. I was worried about not making it to the station in time for my train so I made that my first priority and then just got food from there.

Throughout my time in London, I drank a whole mess of flat whites. Regular coffee isn‚Äôt really a big thing there, everyone drinks espresso drinks. I love cappuccinos and lattes, but I decided I‚Äôd change things up a bit with some flat whites. 
As you‚Äôll see from these posts, I‚Äôm a big fan of taking walking tours to learn more about cities. They‚Äôre a great way to see a lot and learn a lot about the history and cutlure of a city. They tend to give you a lot of highlights and then you can go back later to explore more, if you want. Plus, I just like walking a lot. 
My first day there, I did the SANDEMANs free walking tour with John. He was very British in his sense of humor, which I enjoy a lot. This was a great and fun tour that took us all over Westminster and all of the things to see there.

That evening, I did a Jack the Ripper tour from London Walks. This was utterly fascinating. I learned so much about Jack the Ripper that I had no idea about before. This tour took us around to all of the places of importance to the Jack the Ripper story and provided a lot of context for each. When I was in London in 2009, I did a self-guided Jack the Ripper tour following a guide I had found online, but compared to this, that was a waste of time.

The following day, I did SANDEMANs Alternative Tour with Trevor. This tour was based almost entirely around exploring the street art in Shoreditch. It‚Äôs everywhere and there is so much of it! Trevor told us about some of the artists and told us about the culture. He also showed us an original Banksy. This tour ended at Brick Lane which went nicely into my dinner that night.    

One other tour I did while in London was a Doctor Who walking tour! This was so good! We toured a bunch of filming locations and things from the show, mostly from new Who, but a little bit from classic Who as well. Our guide was Craig and he was fantastic and super nerdy about Doctor Who. I loved it! After the tour, I rushed on over to the police box in Earls Court before catching my train to round out my Doctor Who experience for the day.  

Aside from the guided tours, I did a lot on my own as well. I didn‚Äôt do Westminster Abbey or a few of the other more obvious tourist things since I‚Äôve done them before. I mostly tried to stick with things I hadn‚Äôt done before. I walked through Old Spitalfields Market, explored the Churchill War Rooms, did _one_¬†floor of the Imperial War Museum (I had limited time üòï), walked through a little bit of Tate Modern (I‚Äôd been there before so I just did a few rooms), found Hodge the Cat because cat, closed out the London Transport Museum, and walked through Piccadilly Circus.   
Overall, I really packed my time in London. I didn‚Äôt do much in the way of nightlife type stuff, but I did hit a few pubs and that‚Äôs what matters!

Below are my check-ins on Swarm. Some of them aren‚Äôt places I went into, but instead were just places I was at. Some places I was just stealing wifi or using a bathroom.   

As anyone who follows me on social media has been able to tell, I took a little trip recently. After I was laid off from my job, I knew I needed to take advantage of having a little bit of time and having received a generous severance package. So, enter a two-week solo trip to Europe!

My itinerary was London, Edinburgh, Berlin, and Reykjavik, in that order. Two cities I've been to, two I haven't. And my first backpacking trip. I was super excited! 
Planning was highly stressful and a lot of work. Normally, my wife and I travel together which means we can split some of the planning. She typically handles figuring out where we'll eat. I typically handle travel and accommodations. Activities are a joint effort. Doing a solo trip meant it was all on me to figure out. Not only was it all on me, but I only planned the trip about five weeks ahead of time. And, of course, most of my time in those five weeks was taken up with job interviews and such. So there was a lot to plan with not much time to do it.

The first thing I did was pull up every list of half marathons in Europe in late-July and August. Because of course I'd be running a race on this trip. Of course! Because it's summer, there weren‚Äôt many in the major cities.

I had a rough list of cities I was considering for this trip so was able to match up the races I found with the cities I wanted to travel to. This left me with either Berlin or Reykjavik, both on the same weekend. If I could have done both, I would have, but without at least a full day between them, it wouldn't have been possible pull off without race day packet pick up.

I ended up going with the Reykjavik Half Marathon between the two. I enter the Berlin Marathon lottery every year so sooner or later, I'll be running a race in Berlin anyway. (Spoiler: after the trip, I feel like I need to go back to Reykjavik to run the full marathon some time.)

With that decided, I knew Reykjavik would be the last leg of my trip. Given geography, it had to be either first or last and with the race being August 19th ending there was the only real option.

At this point, I opened up Kayak and Google Flights and just started trying out different flight options and moving cities and dates around to see what happened. Given that train travel costs don't vary the way flights do, I knew it would be the flights that would decide things. This is how I ended up with my exact cities, dates, and order. 
After finding a few flight itineraries that felt reasonable, it was time to pull up Airbnb. I didn't want to do straight up hotels, but I also don't feel comfortable with staying in hostels as a trans women. Having been to London and Berlin before, I already knew roughly where I wanted to stay in the city so it was easy to find a few options there. A few Google searches helped me figure out what parts of Edinburgh and Reykjavik to stay in. Edinburgh Airbnbs were surprisingly expensive, but I later found out why (look for my Edinburgh post for that).

Eventually, I found the right combo of everything that fit a reasonable amount of money to spend and started booking stuff. Once I started, I flew through the bookings and did it as quickly as possible to make sure nothing filled up while I was in the process of booking (which did happen for one of the Airbnbs I had picked).

With flights and accommodations done, I just had to add train travel from London to Edinburgh, but that was quick and easy. I now had four flights, one train ticket, and four Airbnbs booked.

Next, I focused on the whole backpacking thing. I'd never done this before, I'd always taken a regular suitcase traveling with me so I wanted to spend some time reading tips and advice for doing this successfully. The Savvy Backpacker was great for this!

With some research done, I started making purchases‚Äîmany of which I agonized over which options to go with. I bought a new backpack that was just a bit bigger than the largest one I had. I also got a ton of packing cubes‚Äîholy shit, why have I never actually used these before, they're a game changer! I also got a bunch of little things like a travel umbrella, a packable day backpack (I already had packable bags, but not a backpack), TSA locks (I usually don't bother locking my suitcases because if someone wants in, they'll get in, but the locks were more for when I'd be walking around with my bag on my back), and a travel towel (just in case, since I wouldn't be in hotels). We travel a few times a year, but this was the first time I had to _really_ think about each and every thing I was bringing with me. 
Finally, I started actually looking at what I'd be doing in each place. I'm terrible with this part of planning trips and always leave it to a few days before I go. In London and Berlin, there were some things I already knew I wanted to do, either because I liked them a lot previously or because I didn't get to do them when I was there last. Still, I Googled for a lot of articles about traveling to all four cities and asked on Twitter and Facebook for recommendations. And I heavily scoured my friend Ashlea's blog A Globe Well Traveled.

With lists of stuff to see, places to eat, and things to do, I got to work plotting where things were on the map and figuring out what I could logistically fit in. I booked all my tours ahead of time, and there were a lot of them), and added everything else to both Google saved places and Foursquare lists. I downloaded each city for offline use on Google Maps and Google Trips even though I knew I‚Äôd have data on my phone thanks to a T-Mobile plan that includes (_very_) slow international data for free.

I made rough itineraries for each day in my Google Calendar, but I didn't want to get too serious about them because things _never_ go according to plan and you don't usually know how long most things will take. Tours and things that were booked in advance were easy to put on my calendar and I just filled in spaces between them with the things that seemed most interesting to me while keeping everything else on my list easily accessible while on the go. 
Lastly, I had to make a meticulous packing list. I'm always a last-minute packer, but I make up for it with detailed packing lists so I can just grab stuff and throw it in a bag. Needing to pack as light as possible meant having to really think about every single item. I only brought stuff I _knew_ I would need or wouldn't make sense to buy while on go. I looked at weather forecasts and packed as much versatile clothing as possible. Layers that could be reused and combined (especially necessary for Iceland) were a big key. With the exception of one dress and one romper, all of my clothes were picked out so that anything would match with anything.

This part actually wouldn't have been hard at all if not for needing my dilators, needing warmer layers and hiking shoes for Iceland, and being a runner. I knew I'd be able to do laundry in every Airbnb I booked so I packed with that in mind. I really only packed five-ish days of clothes (with extra underwear and socks). Running stuff, I packed the bare minimum with the plan of being able to wear each of my two pairs of shorts and two sports bras twice before washing. Still, needing walking, running, and hiking shoes is what killed me the most. The running shoes were obviously non-negotiable, considering I had 10 runs planned during my trip. And the glacier tour in Iceland required hiking shoes so those were non-negotiable as well. As for my walking shoes, I like to explore places on foot and it‚Äôs not abnormal for me to walk 10-15 miles a day while traveling. Good shoes are a must. 
I debated bringing my DSLR at all and, if so, which lens/lenses to bring. I have a Canon 6D which is more on the professional end of things and weighs a ton compared to smaller DSLRs that are more common. I decided I‚Äôd really hate myself if I didn‚Äôt bring it, but compromised by only bringing a 50mm lens, the smallest and lightest lens I own. Of course, the focus ring on my lens got jammed on the first leg of my trip and I couldn‚Äôt fix while on the go so I spent most of my trip lugging around a heavy camera that I couldn‚Äôt use.

I think that about covers planning stuff. I‚Äôll be, hopefully, writing up posts recapping each city for next week!

I'm still working on a series of blog posts about my recent trip to Europe, but I wanted to do a separate race recap for the Reykjavik half marathon, soooooo here we go!

This race entered my world when I was planning my Europe trip and it fell within the dates I was traveling. I knew I wanted to do a half marathon while abroad, but wasn't sure which city I'd end up doing it in. In the end, it came down to Reykjavik or Berlin. Since I hope to eventually get into the Berlin Marathon lottery, I figured I should opt for a city with fewer chances for me to race in.

Somehow, this was also my first ever international race which added a nice extra bit of excitement. 
The race started Saturday morning at 8:40am and I landed in Iceland at nearly midnight on Thursday night. By the time I got to my Airbnb and to bed, it was just about 2am. This was on top of having been traveling for a week and a half at this point and logging between 15-25 miles on my feet every day between running and sightseeing. My legs were going to be exhausted and there wasn't anything I could do about it, but I knew what I was getting myself into when I registered for the race.

After doing a couple of stops on my sightseeing list for Reykjavik city on Friday, I made my way over to the race expo. The expo was like pretty much any other race expo; a lot of people and a bunch of brands giving out the same kind of stuff as any other expo. The only difference was it was mostly different brands than I'm used to.

I got my bib and timing chip (yes, a separate timing chip to tie on your shoe), grabbed my shirt, and then did a lap around. I took a bunch of the beverage samples and then made my way for the exit. I'm not a big race expo person. I like to do a lap and see what's there, but I don't typically buy things or like to stay long.

The timing chip was one of the plastic reusable ones you tie onto you shoe like we used to use in the US before B-tags became the standard.

I threw my stuff in my backpack and then continued with my sightseeing. I also had booked a beer tasting for that night. üôÉ I wanted to do it after the race, rather than the night before, but the scheduling didn't really work out with some of the other things I wanted to do. So, yeah, I did a üç∫ tasting the night before.

The tasting was at √ñlger√∞in Egils Skallagr√≠msson, Iceland's oldest brewery. I expected it to be like normal tastings where you get little samples of a few beers and that's it. No, this was different. As soon as you walk in, they hand you a pint and that glass is _never_ empty, they just keep refilling it every time you get to the bottom. And then you get to try a ton of their other beers. This was the most beer I've ever had on a "beer tasting" / "brewery tour" before. It was good, but not ideal the night before a half marathon

After the tasting, I got a couple of Iceland's famous hot dogs from B√¶jarins Beztu Pylsu and hit the bed. I didn't even set anything out before going to bed. I just crashed.

In the morning, I woke up, threw on my running clothes and made for the door as quickly as possible. I didn't have to worry about not setting out my clothes the night before because I really didn't have a lot of options with me.

I had 17 miles on my schedule for the day so I did an easy 4-mile warmup along the water and part of the course and then ended right at the start. 
The race started right on time and without a lot of fanfare. The 10k, half marathon, and marathon all started at the same time which made for some crowding, but it wasn't too bad. There were people standing on the corrals holding up pace signs, but they were in minutes/kilometers and none of the Americans knew how to translate that. Luckily, I have an app on my phone that does all kinds of pace related calculations so it was easy for me to find where to be. 
There was no national anthem before the race which made the start all the more unassuming for those of us used to it. They frequently gave warnings for how much time was left, but when the start gun went off, there was no immediate countdown or anything. Not that it matters for anyone not right in the front. 
I had lined up to run around a 1:50 finish. I knew I had tired legs and I'd be doing a glacier hike the next day so I didn't want to push myself. The start was crowded, but I stayed with the pacers for about a mile.

Then, I got antsy.

My legs wanted to gooooooooooo. I started weaving my way up through the crowd. My first mile was an 8:25, but it was my only one over 8 minutes. I was surprised how much my legs were wanting to go, I was feeling good.

Through the first few miles, I just tried not to get too ahead of myself and to enjoy the scenery of such a beautiful city. For the most part, each mile was quicker than the last, but still comfortable.

The weather was cool, about 47¬∫, and sunny with a light breeze, great running weather. I was sweating, but not dripping. I know my body well enough to know I didn't need to take any water during the race under those conditions. So, I didn't bother with any of the stops.

The course was pretty flat until the final third of the race. By this point, I had let my body go with whatever pace felt right and I started dropping into the 7:30s for the middle third. By the last third, I was even faster. I was surprised I had it in me, but I went with it.

The hills in the last third were of no concern for my legs. If anything, I sped up on them. Mile 11 was a 7:15 and then 12 and 13 dropped into the 6:50s. I hadn't run miles that fast in...I don't even know. That's nearly PR 5k for me these days, but these miles felt great on my legs. I wasn't even breathing hard until the final 2/3 of a mile.

From my run the day before and my warm up, I had a pretty good idea of the course in second half so I was able to mentally keep my game on for them and know what was coming up.

As we got to the final few turns, I was finally feeling it. I knew 6:50s weren't really a sustainable pace for me late in a half marathon, but I did know my legs would just about be able to outlast the course so decided to hang on instead of easing back off a little.

Finally, I came around the final turn and saw the finish. I out-kicked a woman on my left and then a man just in front of her saw me coming and kicked much harder than I had left in me. I cruised across the finish line at 1:40:01. Very happy with my time, but annoyed I didn't sneak in under 1:40. Still, this was only 21 seconds slower than my PR and it was sort of...easy? I can't complain! 
I grabbed my medal and smiled at my first international medal. It was a small and unassuming medal, which I actually like. I don't need big giant medals. I grabbed some Powerade and water and then looked for food and heat sheets. There were neither. This was a bit surprising to me. By now, the temperature was still only 54¬∫ so heat sheets were necessary, but there were non. Boo! There was also no food to be had which seemed to be not a good idea considering there was also a marathon running as well. But, the finish is down a main street in downtown Reykjavik so it was easy to pop into a place and get some food. 
My fresh danish was probably better than anything they would have given out anyway.

I didn't hang around long because I needed to go shower, rent a car, and get on with my day. I had booked time at the Secret Lagoon, one of Iceland's hot springs. It was just the thing for after 17 total miles of running!

All-in-all, I really enjoyed this race! It was fun and the city is beautiful. I'm hoping to go back for the marathon some time in the next few years.

Two years ago, Grandma‚Äôs Marathon, a point-to-point race along Lake Superior ending in Duluth, MN was a goal race for me. I worked my ass off in training and was feeling confident for a good race. Then three weeks before the race, everything started to fall apart. Long story short, I did not end up running race‚Ä¶despite going out there to cheer anyway.

This year, Grandma‚Äôs Marathon again became a goal race for me. I put together a training plan I was very excited about that included _many_ half marathons incorporated into my long runs. Unfortunately, little went according to plan. I still ran five half marathons, three 10ks, and a 5-mile race, but I spent much of the last three months dealing with a _really_ frustrating hip injury. Thanks to that injury, I ended up with hardly any training‚Äîas seen below in those screenshots that are sized way too small to actually read ü§∑‚Äç.  

I knew going into the weekend I should have the ability to get to the finish line. I expected it to be a shitshow, but this isn‚Äôt my first rodeo and I‚Äôve been unprepared for marathons before‚Äîhello, almost every time I run Goofy Challenge. 
Grandma‚Äôs is a Saturday race so I flew out on Thursday to give myself a little time to not rush before the race. I flew into Minneapolis-St Paul which¬†left me a two and a half hour drive to get to Duluth. Everything for my travel was entirely uneventful and I showed up at the hotel with plenty of time to check in, relax for a bit, and then walk over to the expo. The expo was pretty dead when I got there and¬†I was able to get my stuff right away, do a quick lap, and get out.

Unfortunately, I‚Äôm two for two at crying at the Grandma‚Äôs expo now. Two years ago, I was crying over my DNS, this year I was crying over being laid off literally the day before. Oh well, shit happens. I‚Äôm fine (for real). 
Friday was an easy chill day. I hung out at a coffee shop for a bit to get some stuff done, walked around downtown and the finish area, did a shakeout run with my friend Sophie, watched Kara Goucher speak, and then grabbed dinner with my friend Kimmie. It was a nice day and just what I needed to get my spirits back up and accept my layoff. I spent most of the day with a big smile on my face.  

Since Sophie‚Äôs hotel was still back in Minneapolis, I offered to let her crash in my room the night before. We woke up around 5am, threw our clothes on, and walked over to the buses to the start. We had hoped to make the train, but it seemed as though we ended up being a few minutes too late for that so we hopped on one of the school buses.

The ride over was relaxed and Sophie got to experience pre-marathon Amelia who doesn‚Äôt like marathons. Like, let me tell you, in the week before marathons leading right up to the starting gun, I¬†_hate_ the marathon. Hate it. Hate it. Hate it. And I'm miserable to be around because all I do is complain about it. 
We got to the starting area very early. The temperature was cool, but with some humidity. At points, there were sprinkles, but not much. The forecast called for rain around noon, but clear skies during most of the race.

Anyway, after hitting the porta-potties and checking our bags, we split up. Sophie was going for a BQ so she seeded herself a bit ahead of where I did since I was planning on taking it nice and easy. I was surprised the start corral was entirely self-seeded. It‚Äôs not a _massive_ race, but it‚Äôs still 8,700 runners. I expected there to be some sort of predefined corrals. For the most part, everyone seeded themselves according to the pacers in the corrals. I lined up right next to the 3:45 pacers. I had planned to run a 3:50, but there was no pacer that and I was confident I could hang at 3:45 even without much training. But as the corrals filled and we got walked up, I ended up quite a bit in front of the pacers before the race started. Honestly, I don't know why I even bother. I haven't actually run with a pace group for a marathon in nearly four years.

The wait in the corral seemed like it was ages and I was antsy to get the shitshow on the road. Eventually, with little fanfare, we were off! 
I didn‚Äôt have a solid race plan other than to just keep it steady and easy early on. I started off extra slow trying to let the 3:45 pace group catch up to me. It took a while, but they finally did‚Ä¶only to have me drop them again pretty quickly after that. As I fell into my natural rhythm, I noticed I was running quite a bit faster than planned, but my effort was really easy. Because¬†I run by effort, I trusted the feel¬†over any numbers. Though, I had my watch switched to manual lapping so my mile splits were exact to the mile markers instead of whatever GPS approximation I was going to get from my Garmin. This at least allowed me to keep a read on what my feel was translating to. I only ever check my watch on the mile, never in between.

Even though my effort was very low, my legs didn‚Äôt feel great. It wasn‚Äôt a feeling of them being worked, but more just them not wanting to be running at all. I know my body well enough to know not to worry about that feeling so I did my best to ignore it. However, I did check in on my heart rate regularly. Even though I was running by feel, I wanted that information available to me. Through the first half of the race, I was 147-151 which is nice and low.

While¬†it was cool _before_ the race, the sun was now out and it was warming up quickly. The temperature was much higher than I‚Äôd prefer for a marathon. When I could, I favored the left side of the road which had off-and-on shade, only breaking from that to hit the tangents around right turns. The race has¬†_very_ few turns, but there are a lot of curves in the road.

Crowd support was rather light. There would be some groups of people cheering when we‚Äôd pass by a lodge or something on the side of the road, but mostly it was a very quiet first half.

The few times I had looked at the elevation chart, it looked like it was relatively flat race with a 100ft net downhill. I guess I didn‚Äôt look close enough at the scale, though, because I was surprised to find the course is pretty much rolling hills the entire time. There aren‚Äôt really any big climbs, but you‚Äôre rarely running flat. Some runners enjoy this variation, but most of my miles are logged on very flat routes so I‚Äôm not in the kind of hill shape I used to be. I was glad I had run the hills in Central Park the last three weekends before the race. At least that was something.

Anyway, I kept my effort very even though the first half of the race, but if you look at my splits, there is a lot variation from the hills. I didn‚Äôt increase or decrease my effort while going up or down, I just kept doing what I was doing.

As we approached the halfway mark, there were more and more people cheering. Because there is also a half marathon that starts at the 13.1 point, the set up was still there and I guess people hung around to cheer. This was a nice little boost.

I crossed the half at 1:49:42.  Checking in with my body at the halfway point, I was liking how I was feeling. I felt like I should have a negative split in the cards if I kept up what I was doing. However, it was getting _quite_ warm. I had been sweating pretty heavily for most of the race already and while I was taking water at most stops, I wasn‚Äôt getting that much down.

The next few miles ticked off like nothing while I kept things steady. My heart rate eventually started creeping into the upper 150s, but nothing I was worried about.

By mile 17, I was in the best of moods. I had a big smile on my face and just couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about how much I love the marathon. This kept up through most of mile 19. That mile was a pretty big downhill and my second fastest mile of the race. By this point I had stopped worrying too much about my effort level and let it creep up a little when it felt right.

The reason why I say¬†‚Äúmost of mile 19‚Äù up there is because things changed pretty quickly for me. Before I even got to the mile marker, I went from ‚Äúaw haww‚Äù to ‚Äúoooohhhhh noooooo.‚Äù Things started feeling harder and I was no longer having such an easy time. I was still okay, but I knew it wouldn‚Äôt be a fun seven miles to the finish. My biggest problem was the¬†dehydration must have started setting¬†in because I started getting nauseous. I would end up dealing with this nausea to different degrees for the remainder of the race.

The one plus side here, though, was that we had started to make it into town and there were people out cheering and playing music. As I crossed the 20th mile marker, I knew I was good to make it to the finish, but that I wouldn‚Äôt be enjoying the last 10k. I just said to myself ‚Äúit‚Äôs basically just one lap around Central Park..._without_ Harlem Hill.‚Äù

Miles 21 and 22 felt fooooorever long. I was still keeping a pretty reasonable pace, but I felt like I was going slower. The 22nd mile marker was at the base of basically the last climb of any decent length. When I saw the hill coming, I knew I was going to be struggling to get up it so, as soon as I hit it, I switched into a strong arm swing to power myself up. I think it was about 80% my arms that got me up there. That and seeing Kimmie cheering and .

Crossing the 23rd mile marker, I slightly lied to myself and said ‚Äúokay, just a 5k to go.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt worry too much about that other .1. We were starting to get closer to downtown Duluth, where I had cheered two years ago. This was the part I knew I needed to get to. I knew the energy there would bring me in. By now, I was starting to actually slow down. My legs were tired and my nausea was‚Ä¶not great. There were a couple points where I thought I was going to have to stop and puke. I tried not to think about it too much. 
As we made our way down Superior in downtown, I stuck as far left as I could to stay in what remaining shade I could find. The crowd was _very_ loud and the buildings helped to really echo the sound. It was extremely encouraging. When I finally saw the 25th marker coming up, I knew I was getting close. I knew didn‚Äôt have to dig in for much longer.

I also knew at that marker, there was a left turn and the last tiny hill up an overpass. Once we were over that, it was flat to the finish. I had nothing left to push with because of my nausea, but I also knew my time was good and I was probably going to pull off a negative split and a sub-3:40 finish. I was pretty stoked about that, but more stoked by the idea of being done.

We hooked around the convention center and along the harbor and finally made our last turn. As I saw the finish line come into view, I was so happy to be there, but it felt so far away.

After what felt like years, I finally crossed the finish looking better than I felt, at least according to my finish video.

A 3:38:55 was good enough for a negative split and my second fastest marathon time since transitioning. 
My legs felt completely trashed and all I wanted was to drink everything in sight. I think I looked like I had fallen in a pool, I was so sweaty. I walked around to try to keep my legs moving and grabbed my free beer. I ended up gulping it down pretty quickly so I could start walking back to the hotel. I made sure to walk along the course as much as possible so I could cheer while walking. As I walked more, my legs started to loosen back up a bit at least. 
I‚Äôm really glad to have actually run the race after my DNS two years ago. I ran a pretty solid race even though I was struggling the last few miles. I think this makes five straight marathons I‚Äôve negative split which is pretty rad. Though, that said, my splits this race were super duper erratic. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had such erratic splits during a race before‚Ä¶or even in a training run. I tend to be¬†steady with an overall negative trend. In this race, I was all over the place, up and down. It‚Äôs not a thing I was worrying much about during the race or am worried about now. I know my effort was pretty even through the first 18-19 miles and the variations were due to the hills each mile. It‚Äôs just strange. 
I really like Duluth as a city. It‚Äôs charming and quaint and everyone is very friendly. It feels like it could be the 8th town in Nightmare Before Christmas, Marathon Town. It feels like this is something they‚Äôre preparing for all year and the people really love the event. The race is well organized while maintaining a very personal and small-town feel. It‚Äôs a good vibe. The crowd support for the first 3/4 of the race is light, but there was¬†plenty later on when it mattered.

I‚Äôm happy to have marathon number 11 in the books and I‚Äôm grateful to have had a decent race considering the last three months. And that brings me to my hip... Notice how I didn‚Äôt mention it during the race? Yeah, it wasn‚Äôt a thing, really. I‚Äôd say there were _maybe_ five to ten total minutes added up through the race when I even felt it at all. I was staying very focused on my breathing and that was doing the trick. Those little bits when I did feel something, and we‚Äôre talking like a 1 out of 10, were when I had stopped breathing properly.
The marathon! Not only is the marathon my favorite race distance, but the Walt Disney World Marathon is one of my favorite courses and easily the most magical of them all! 
I set out my clothes and got to bed nice and early for the marathon. I‚Äôm pretty sure that even with my 3:25am wake-up, I still got seven hours of sleep. Pretty good! I would have probably gotten even more if I didn‚Äôt spend forever the night before worrying about what to wear.

This year‚Äôs race was _cold_. Okay, not cold for someone who lives in New Jersey, but cold for a race in Florida. The starting temperature was around 38¬∫ with 15-20mph wind. At home, this isn‚Äôt really that bad. In fact, with a race temperature that was predicted to be around 40-44¬∫ for most of the race, this is just about perfect racing conditions to me. Minus that wind, of course.

But, this wasn‚Äôt home. I wasn‚Äôt just walking out my front door and taking off like I normally do when I run in the cold. I had to wait around in that cold for the race to start. This is bad enough for most races, but runDisney races are exceptionally bad with how long you have to wait before the race. First, you have to deal with taking a bus to the starting area which means waiting for that and leaving extra time, _just in case_. Then you have to walk close to half a mile from the bus to the staging area with the bag check. THEN¬†it‚Äôs another 20ish-minute walk to the corrals. Add in leaving time to hit a porta-potty, meet up with friends, and get into the corrals before they close without having a close call‚Äîlike I did for the 5k‚Äîand you‚Äôre talking 60-90 minutes of being outside before the race. Not bad when the weather is nice, but brutal when it‚Äôs cold.

After a lot of back and forth regarding shorts vs crop tights and short sleeves vs long sleeves and throwaway arm warmers vs real arm warmers, I opted for Oiselle Distance Shorts (basically my standard issue marathon shorts), my Chicago Marathon short sleeve shirt, and Oiselle lux arm warmers as my race outfit. Prior to the race, I kept on a pair of loose joggers, the cotton t-shirt from the Disney 5k, the Dopey Challenge long sleeve we got this year, and a couple mylar heat sheets (one as a skirt, one for my top). 
When my alarm went off, I was surprisingly awake and ready to get up and go. I gobbled down a Clif bar and drank some water, but I was trying to be conservative with how much I drank. I know hydration is important even when it‚Äôs cold out, but I also knew I wouldn‚Äôt want to be dealing with hitting porta-potties any more than I needed to in the cold. I quickly got dressed and Ellen and I headed out to catch the bus. Luckily, there was one waiting for us and we were able to get right on without waiting out in the cold! The ride was quick and so was the walk to the staging area. There was only a short line to get through bag check. It was cold, but it didn‚Äôt yet feel _super_ cold.

We hit up the standard We Are Awesome Runner Friends meeting spot and chatted it up with the group. Everyone was cold, especially Nathan who lives right near Disney and isn‚Äôt used to the cold at all. Our friend Lauren¬†came by to visit for a minute so we could get our group photo, but then she went back to the heated VIP tent like some kinda jerk! *insert me pouting here*

Eventually, it was time to check our bags and move out. When I pulled my joggers off, I literally screamed as the cold touched my bare legs. It was not pleasant! I quickly got my mylar heat sheets all tied around me and dropped my bag off. The walk to the starting area was the standard runDisney affair and all I could think about was hours from then when I was nice and warm again. Though, I did question if I‚Äôd ever be warm again. We were lucky to find some short lines for the porta-potties and took care of business‚ÄîI must say, this was a minor feat in itself with all of the heat sheets and layering to deal with.

I got into the corral with plenty of time to stand and wait around. I just did my best to stay huddled up with myself. For some reason, Disney put me in corral E which isn‚Äôt really where I belong. I hate saying that and sounding like I actually care or think it matters or compare myself to other runners (I _really_ don‚Äôt), but I was corral C last year and the time I gave was within the corral C range (and faster than the one I gave for last year). Plus, I‚Äôm a 3:28 marathoner. Still, I didn‚Äôt care _too_ much since I wasn‚Äôt planning on _racing_. In fact, starting in corral E probably matched up much more with my plan to run just around a 4-hour marathon. 
Anyway, time flew by pretty quickly and it was time to go before I knew it! Which was good because I was violently shivering! While I had seriously debated¬†if I could actually run while keeping the heat sheets tied around me, I ditched them as the corral before us got going. The announcers said they might interfere with the timing mat and I knew they‚Äôd just annoy my anyway. Some runners did start with them on though! They looked hilarious while actually running! 
The corrals ahead of us went quickly and there were no mini waves so the corrals to off started with little delay between them. Amazingly, the moment I started running, I forgot about the cold and was _totally_ fine. In fact, from race start to finish, the weather was a _complete_ non-issue for me. It was basically perfect.

I started things off easy and¬†focused on keeping myself¬†steady. My plan to stay just under 4:00 meant my target pace was around 9:09.

I clocked in my first mile at 8:57. A tad faster than I planned, but not too shabby at all. The important thing was to just stay controlled in this first mile and set a good tone for the race going forward. Just past the first mile marker, I ripped my throwaway shirt off Hulk Hogan style. Just tore it right down the front like a total badass! We can ignore the fact that I had pre-cut the neck to make the hole bigger and easier to take off during my run.

Most of the way to Magic Kingdom was quiet and uneventful. I think runners were still pretty cold and the cheer sections on the highway were a less filled than normal. One thing I noticed was the lines for photos were really short. This was a trend that continued the entire race and, after the first two or three of them, they were never more than five or six people deep‚Äîmost were like _maybe_ one runner. This was shocking to me. It was cold out, which I suspect was a big reason for it, but with the half marathon having been canceled, I‚Äôd have expected Dopey and Goofy runners to be upping their photo game. I didn‚Äôt stop for any of these early photos myself, though.

As we passed the fourth mile marker, my pace was pretty steady. My legs were okay, but not as good as I would‚Äôve liked (pretty sure I say this in every marathon recap I do). The section right around here¬†is where the second big cheer section is (if you include the one on the highway going into the Magic Kingdom) and it was fantastic! The cold did _not_ keep people from being out here¬†and getting their NOISE¬†on! It was such a nice surprise to see these amazing people out there.

Just after we sailed through this cheer section, I stopped at a bank of porta-potties for a quick pee-pee break. When I came out, I took a moment to take off my long sleeve top and neatly tie it around my waist nice and tight before I started running again. This made for a longer stop than planned, but it beat having to pull it off and tie it while running. It also meant less risk of losing a headband or something in the process.

Once I started moving again,¬†I still felt like I had to pee. I felt this the entire race. I knew I didn‚Äôt have to, but I never stopped feeling like I had to pee. Ugh!

As we made our way past the 5th mile marker and into Magic Kingdom, I couldn‚Äôt believe how quickly it felt like this had come up. Main Street U.S.A. was packed and loud, just like always! So much excite! I didn‚Äôt stop for any selfies here like I usually do because I wanted to just focus on my running. But as we came through Tomorrowland, I saw Buzz Lightyear with only a short line waiting for him. I hopped in line and then he promptly walked away. WTF BUZZ! I decided not to wait for him, but I did see Patrick as I took off to leave again. Just a little ways up, I made up for it with a photo with Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum. 
Then it was through Fantasyland, both new and old, and Cinderella‚Äôs Castle‚ÄîI stopped for a photo, of course. Coming through Frontierland, I stopped for a quick shot with one of the Country Bears and then got back into my rhythm as we passed the 10k marker.  By this point, I had only taken water once. I knew it was important, but I didn‚Äôt want to risk spilling it all over my face or getting my gloves wet with the temperature where it was. I know my body and knew I went to bed hydrated so I kept my water breaks to about three throughout the course of the race. Instead, I used the water breaks to thank all of the volunteers for being out there. 
Through the first 10k of the race, I had lost just about 3.5 minutes to my pee break and photos. Hardly anything for a Disney race! 
The section between the two Kingdoms is always a tough part of the race. It‚Äôs nearly 10k and, unlike the section between Animal Kingdom and ESPN, you‚Äôre still early in the race and needing to stay controlled.

I stopped for a few photos along here with the characters that were out. There were no lines so it hardly cost me any time at all. 
My mile splits were a little erratic through this section of the course as I fought with my body wanting to pick it up a little and my brain knowing I shouldn‚Äôt, especially since my legs were feeling tired already. I was nice and warmed up and started pulling my arm warmers down. I wanted to pull them off completely, but I was afraid I'd need them after Animal Kingdom while on the highway with nothing blocking the wind‚ÄîI tried to figure out which way the wind would be blowing there and thought it would be a headwind. My fear with pulling them off is that they'd be a pain to pull back on when I needed them again. So I just left them pulled down to my forearms.

There used to be a section of the course here that lapped around the Disney World Speedway, but the Speedway doesn‚Äôt exist anymore. Last year, there was a new out-and-back section added around mile 11. It was a boring stretch of plain road just to even out the miles a bit. This year, the out-and-back was in the same place but went out farther than last year. I wasn‚Äôt surprised by this when we hit it, though. I knew there would have to be some section to make up for the changes in Hollywood Studios caused by the construction of Star Wars Land (I really hope they don‚Äôt call it Star Wars Land when it‚Äôs done). The weird thing about this though was, from mile 11 on, all the mile markers were moved from where they previously were the last few years. It wasn‚Äôt a lot, but up until the 23rd one, they all came up a little sooner on the course than before. It was actually a nice surprise at times.

Anyway, the section between the two Kingdoms flew by way faster than it ever seemed to before. Maybe it‚Äôs my growing experience with this race (5th time running it), who knows? My only complaint here was the RV hillbillies¬†that I always loved to take photos with were gone. Instead, they were replaced with a couple of hippies with an RV. Not the same!

Sadly, the animals that are typically out as you approach Animal Kingdom were¬†MIA this year. My guess is it was just too cold for them. This was disappointing, but understandable! We made our way into Animal Kingdom and through Africa and Asia. Asia was nice this year with the construction fencing from¬†last year being gone now.

We hit the halfway mark and I checked in with my watch. 1:59:22. Right on schedule! I knew most of my photo ops were behind me and I was picking it up so I wouldn‚Äôt have much trouble negative splitting if my untrained legs didn‚Äôt bonk.  We came out of Animal Kingdom, passed the 14th mile marker, and then came around to one of my favorite photo stops, the graveyard! This year, I went for a zombie style photo, but it didn‚Äôt come out as well as I‚Äôd have liked. 
Mile 15 came right up after that and the rest of these highway miles ticked off like nothing. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt see one of my other favorite photo ops, Phineas and Ferb, along this stretch where they typically are.

As we made the turn towards ESPN Wide World of Sports, I was feeling pretty good and my splits had dropped down in to the low 8s. As we entered into Wide World of Sports, I took my second gel. Typically, I take one every five miles, but I only ended up taking two this whole race. I just wasn‚Äôt really feeling like I‚Äôd need them.

Wide World of Sports has a ton of turns, but they‚Äôre not too bad if the course isn‚Äôt crowded and you‚Äôre not trying to PR. We did our lap around the track and then into the stadium with lots of energy. Heading into the stadium I passed Joy and Sadness! And there wasn't a single person in line! I had to snatch that photo up!  I was feeling good as we crossed 20 miles, but I was starting to feel like I had to poop a little bit.¬†I had done some mental math through this section and realized if I kept going as I was, a 3:45 finish was possible. It was going to be close, but I could push for it. 
This is the last quiet section of the course and the section I consider to be the last part you have to worry about.

Coming¬†out of Wide World of Sports, we hit a wall of wind in our faces. This was the only part of the race where the wind was even something I noticed, but it was stupid.

As we passed 21, I was starting to tire a lot, but that was probably more due to the fact that my pace dropped into the 7:40s for this whole section rather than stay steady where it was in the low 8s.

This section also features the last two hills of the course. The first of which is probably the worst one of the whole race. It‚Äôs _really_ not that bad, but it‚Äôs a highway onramp so it‚Äôs banked and a big wide turn. This is the point of the race that I always think of as the ‚Äújust gotta get past here‚Äù point.

After nearly a mile, we hit that second little hill which was smaller than I remembered. After that, we made our turn into Hollywood Studios! Nothing but fun from here on out!

 

As I mentioned above, the Hollywood Studios section was different this year because of the construction. This year, we entered over by Fantasmic‚Ä¶ish. The course followed some of the walkway between¬†Sunset Blvd and where¬†the amphitheater is and popped us out behind Tower of Terror where the ride lets you out. The park was open by now so you could have taken a quick detour to the Twilight Zone, if you wanted.¬†From here, we ran down Sunset Blvd to Hollywood Blvd. This was actually a really cool change to the course. As much as I LOVE Streets of America (RIP), this might be even better.

After we got back onto Hollywood Blvd, the course was the same as ever. We exited by the front of the park and made our way over to the walkway along the river towards the Crescent Lake resorts and Epcot.

By this point, I was passing runners left and right, but I was ready for the race to be over. As we approached the Beach and Yacht Club, I started looking for Danielle who was cheering outside of our room. We spotted each other at the same time and as I flew on by, I yelled ‚ÄúI gotta poop!!!‚Äù at her. The people around her didn‚Äôt know how to handle this. 
The section along Crescent Lake quickly ended and I was feeling exhausted, but powering through with what I had left in me. I really was trying to get under 3:45! Of course, the Boardwalk along the Beach and Yacht Club here is where the "you're almost there!"s started. Oof. I must have heard it a dozen times before even getting into Epcot. Seriously, folks, don't say this if¬†the finish line isn't within eyesight.

As we turned into the World Showcase, I knew the 25th mile marker was just on the other side of the UK Pavilion as we crossed into France. I lapped my watch for a 7:29 mile here and told myself it was just 1.2 to go.

The countries ticked off as we traveled around the world on our way to Mexico and then¬†into Futureworld. The final bit. As we passed under Spaceship Earth, I looked for the 26th mile marker and lapped my watch for a 7:21. I was shocked I had just run my fastest mile of the day with how I was feeling for the last couple of miles. 
We exited the park and there was the beautiful finish line staring me down. I heard my name called by the announcers and then sailed across the finish line.

3:43:29!
 
Last year, I dry-heaved at the finish and thought I was going to throw up for the last 10k. The year before, I thought I was going to shit my pants for the last 10k and thought it was all going to come out the moment I stopped running. This year, I didn‚Äôt feel either. I had to poop, but it wasn't an emergency...yet. Whew!

I collected my marathon, Dopey, Goofy, and half marathon medals (runners of the challenges got their half medal here) and then stopped for some photos before hopping on a bus back to the resort. Now, my body has collected itself a little and that poop was ready to come out. I barely got back to the room in time. It was a real photo finish!  After I got in the shower, I was dismayed to find out that I had forgotten to put Body Glide on my lower back to protect from my shorts' waistband. Oiselle's Distance Shorts are great for marathons because of their three pockets, but their waistband will fuck you up if you're not careful. While I did put Body Glide on my thighs, I had also forgotten to do under my bra, but that somehow escaped unscathed.

That night, we met up with the We Are Awesome Runner Friends group at Whispering Canyon Cafe at the Wilderness Lodge where we pigged out on delicious food and PRed in milkshakes. And Lauren drank two liters of Diet Coke.  

I‚Äôm _really, really_ happy with my time for this race. Not only was this a 16.5 minute course record for me, but I negative split by 15 minutes. And this is my second fastest marathon since transitioning. If I hadn‚Äôt run Chicago back in October, this would have been a PR.

I had a lot of fun with Dopey this year. While doing four races over four days that all start at 5:30am is stressful, these races are a lot of fun and really enjoyable.  Finally, one additional change that Disney made this year was to start using their own photographers for race photos. No more¬†MarathonFoto. The great part about this is it enables you to add them to your Disney PhotoPass and they start showing up pretty quickly after the race. My guess is Disney is using a lot of facial recognition software here to pull this off, which also explains how I have some photos where you can't see my bib at all. But the best part about this change is that Annual Passholders get their PhotoPass photos for free so FREE RACE PHOTOS!

Finally finally, I ran the entire Dopey Challenge, all 48.6 miles, with my phone in my hand. I don't typically run with it and being an iPhone 7 Plus, it's too big for any pockets so it had to stay in my hand. Anyway, it wasn't an issue at all until two hours after the marathon when it fell out of my jacket pocket and the screen cracked. ACK!

Wait, one more finally! I really loved the medals from the races this year. The retro style of the marathon and half marathon medals was fantastic!

It's marathon time. I guess. Well, not I guess, actually. It¬†_is_ marathon time. Tomorrow. Oof.

For the most part, training went better than I had expected, but one part of marathoning that I'm really bad at is managing the nerves leading up to the race. I've be super stressed about it for the last two weeks. This is typical for me, but this time around it's even worse.

I got a later start running consistently again after surgery than I hoped so my base wasn't anywhere near where I wanted it to be by the time I started my training. I adjusted for this as much as I could with my plan and put together one of the least aggressive training plans I've ever done.

After a few weeks of training, though, my body started to really fall into sync. I was kicking ass on my runs and feeling pretty good. I run by effort rather than by trying to hit certain paces and it was turning out that my runs¬†were overall much faster than I thought I could run at all effort levels.

As training progressed, my goal for the race started to move from "probably just want to be around 3:40" to BQ to "I don't think 3:28 is impossible." My training runs were faster than they have been for any marathon training cycle since Chicago 2012, which was before I transitioned. I was pleasantly surprised with that. 
I should make a clarification here, though. My mid-week runs were great. Even my longest, hardest runs during the week were beyond solid. By the end, I was crushing nine and ten milers at paces near my 5k PR. In fact, I had a 7-miler during a step back week that was a faster overall pace than my 5k PR and I felt fantastic doing it. Even my stupidly easy effort runs were quick despite some of the lowest heart rates I've since on runs since I started monitoring it.

What wasn't consistently great were my long runs. Some were good. One was _really_ good. Most were eh. And a couple were "god fucking dammit." One of my 17-milers got split into two runs, a morning one and an afternoon one. And my 19-miler was cut at 11 because I was feeling terrible in every way and gave up. And my last long run, a 21-miler, didn't happen at all.

Three weeks out from marathon day, I ran a half marathon. This was built into my training plan from the beginning. The race was on a 20-mile day and I ran 10k before it to cover most of the extra miles and then another mile after. The race went really well. I ran faster than I expected. Unfortunately, I also ran faster than planned and than I should have. I was sore afterwards, but I chalked it up to DOMS and then continued into my peak week of training without making adjustments to properly recover. I did my runs at an slightly easier effort, but I didn't adjust my mileage or run _as_ easy as I should have. By the end of the week I was still sore and started to have some pain on the outside of my right thigh. I massaged it a lot, but that seemed to only make matters worse. Come the Sunday following my race, I knew running a long run was going to be a bad idea. The pain had moved down along the length of my IT band from my hip down into my knee. I decided to take three days completely off. I wasn't thrilled about losing a 21-miler, but avoiding injury is priority number one and I'd rather risk my time than risk my ability to run at all.

In addition to skipping a couple of runs, I also made an appointment with a sports physical therapist who is also a runner right away. I didn't want to mess around. I got three appointments in with her where she mostly focused on massaging my _very_ tight legs. With less than two weeks to go, there wasn't time for much else. Just massage, foam rolling, and a few exercises to loosen things up. It definitely helped, but physical therapy isn't magic. 
My runs during taper have been very easy effort, but my legs have been tired and garbagy. It's really hard to feel out where they're at right now. There is still some soreness in some spots, but the pain has mostly settled in behind¬†the top couple inches of my IT band. This is the same place I had problems four years ago going into Chicago, but this is a bit more intense.

Ultimately, it feels okay enough to run on. I know it's going to be uncomfortable during the race and recovery is going to be a bit harder and longer, but DNSing doesn't feel like the necessary move here. I might just be being stubborn about it, but my physical therapist doesn't seem too worried about it as far as my decision to run.

This does affect my goal a lot though. Missing that last long run after having a couple others not go well worries me for the last 10k of the race. My overall milage through training was lower than I normally do so I don't have much confidence that my legs are ready for the distance.

I still haven't fully decided exactly what my exact plan is for tomorrow yet. If I hadn't developed this issue and had done my last long run, I'd be shooting for 3:30 as my A goal with a stretch of 3:27 or 3:28. Now I'm leaning more towards a 3:33 with 3:30 as my stretch, 3:37 as my B goal, and 3:40 as my C goal. This is still not fully decided though.

Boston 2018 is the day after my 35th birthday so I get an extra five minutes on my qualifying time. 3:40 will qualify me, but it's looking like 3:37 is the slowest I can go to have a decent chance of actually getting in, based on the last few years.

I had thought about pulling back my goals a lot for this race and not actually¬†_racing_ it, but looking at how my race schedule is coming along for the spring (and with Dopey in January), it looks like this might be my last chance to make a BQ attempt before next fall. To be fair, a BQ attempt wasn't really on the table when I started training. I didn't think it'd be a reality at all, but my training makes me feel like a goal for a¬†_race_ any slower than BQ time would be selling myself short.

In the end, I hope to play it smart tomorrow and listen to my body. Not being injured is the most important thing so if my assessment is wrong, I need to be smart and stop. The key will be starting out slow and not taking off at the start like I always do no matter how hard I try not to. If I can have a slow start for the first couple of miles, I can feel things out and then hopefully stay stronger throughout the rest of the race. A lot of this race may be a play-by-ear situation.
