If you think experiencing joy for a short period of time is a distraction, then you've already lost everything you're fighting to hold on to
Heaven forbid people turned off for a bit to have silly fun with something and experience joy in this increasingly joyless world.

Yeah. The housing market is out of control again.
God created 3 and 4 bedroom houses only. Anything else is an abomination!
jfc twitter, just let me edit tweets already so I can fix all those typos back there because i'm bad at typing &amp; too impulsive to proofread
Obviously, that last tweet should say "buying houses." Whatever.
Exactly
So get the fuck off our generation's collective back about being goddamn houses
Spending more time commuting and being farther from the things we like to do isn't the tradeoff we want to make right now.
Or we'd have to move further away from the city which would increase our commutes and decrease our quality of life
To buy a house where we live would cost at least $500k for something we'd be happy living in. At least!
Like, we actually can afford to buy a house, but that wouldn't be a good investment for us
For a lot of us, NOT buying a house is actually the smart and responsible choice, even if we can afford one
And let's not ignore that baby boomers fucked our country in so many ways that actually spending money on a house is rarely a good idea now
There is no winning for millennials. No matter what we do, we're told we're doing the wrong thing.
Doesn't even matter what that thing is, whether simply putting food in ourselves or actually enjoying our ONE miserable life on this planet
And any spending of any money on anything else is seen as some sort of wasteful decadence.
The problem is that millennials are expected to spend exactly $0 on anything that isn't saving for a house or buying fucking diamonds
$150 worth of alcohol 104 nights/year is a completely ridiculous vision of how millennial spend their money, but th‚Ä¶

But none of these races want to implement a very simple &amp; effective solution bc they bank on x% of registered runners not running each race
And this goes for pretty much all races, not just NYRR races.

They could easily charge $5-10 for transfer to cover any costs or even make money too.

A coffee shop that doesn't want me to hang out unless I talk to ppl is missing out on me getting a 2nd/3rd/etc cup of coffee bc I'm leaving
their mental health/issues/quirks/whatever aren't real and could be solved just by being forced to talk to people.
If you're a coffee shop who doesn't offer wifi so people will talk, you're giving so many people the finger and telling them
Some people are introverts and being social is intensely exhausting.
And sitting in a coffee shop keeping to yourself is a big win and as good as being social for you.
It's such a slap in the face for anyone who has (social) anxiety. Sometimes just leaving the house is a big deal.
I'm really sick of coffee shops that don't offer wifi for the purpose of encouraging people to talk to each other

Haha! The bag check area is so small. I'm just hanging out in the equivalent spot though
I walked over to see if I could find you and it's pretty crowded over there. Damn.
How long is it?
either of you here yet?
Oh no. Can I pretend that this didn't happen? I don't want him ruined for me :(
I wouldn't want you too
Have a great race!!!!!!
Is everything okay? Send my hugs and love

It's my favorite race distance but it doesn't come without a lot of pain and sacrifice
marathons are dumb
This is one of those really tiny things that is super frustrating
Awesome! I'll send an email to the address listed at the bottom of the article! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thanks for sharing your story, Isaac! If interested,I'd love to send you an invite to the FB group I started for trans runners

and it's only $15!
This is perfect from beginning to end!
maybe!

Okay, I'll do this while waiting in lines at Disney this weekend. Phone will stay in my pocket. Maybe.‚Ä¶
Yessir!
The fact that I exist makes me inherently evil üôÑ

literally same
you'd think they'd at least TRY to show real diversity
Putting the problem right out on display.
Nah, I'm good.
Ugh.

I'm going to end up buying a ticket for this stupid thing. Ugh.
Best pull request title I've ever written
Staying healthy for ü¶Ñ is the most important thing for sure
Yeah, that's the thing, is a whole year out, but it's easy to get stuck on an injury cycle that lasts that long
OMG those people are the worst! Like, get some paint, yo
Yikes!
It'd be fantastic if I could walk with a cup of hot coffee without spilling it down my leg
oh
The problem is, I really don't know how it will feel or what the situation is with it
Yeah, I mean, as a rule, I don't *race* Disney races. I just have fun, but even running slow could hurt
Hah! She is not running the race
I guess since it's a runDisney race, I could just walk instead of DNFing if I need to, but it's just so a weird mindset to have for a race
My hip is being a jerk and my PT's advice is to see how it goes, but take a DNF if there's pain that's more than a 5/10.
I'm running #StarWarsHalf and 10k this weekend and it's weird going into it knowing I may need to DNF
I mean, yeah, the whole country is going to start crumbling more and more
I hate that we'd have to move back to the suburbs if we wanted to buy and probably like a whole diff region of the country
Like, I just scream "I KNOW I MAKE LIKE TWICE AS MUCH MONEY AS YOU AND MY BUDGET WOULD BE HALF THAT!"
Seriously, Robbie, WTF is going on with your transportation infrastructure down there?
There's hardly an episode of House Hunters where my mind isn't broken by these people's budgets

I get this same feeling when driving and my watch is vibrating constantly
Nice!!
Not ready for this season to end
I'm not sure. I think it might not?
I like pickles too!
I like it for the everything! You gotta try the wasabi ones!
I LOVE seaweed snacks! We stock them at work in our snack zones.
Drinking it was basically that in reverse
Everyone who had a unicorn frap today should get together for a postmortem to discuss our poop colors
Did the sugar kill you like it did me?
All Slack instances should have
This is horrifying
It is for like two sips
I hoped to never have to face this reality!
We went over this! The problem is that I really do want this, but I know I'll be disappointed. i can't win.
Ugh. Jawbreaker reuniting is honestly my nightmare. I hate this.
Same :/
I was the only distance runner there so it was a new concept for most of them that this is a thing
It's funny, that's what we were talking about while waiting for our drinks (a bunch of us went), how runners always talk poop
oh
I'M REALLY HOPING IT MAKES MY POO THAT COLOR!
Yeah, it's a lot of sugar. I got a tall with almond milk to cut down on overall calories. I drank like 2/3 of it.
It died of diabetes
I was curious!
The whipped cream is good!
It's not great, but it's not the worst thing ever
This isn't super good. It's not terrible, but I wouldn't ever order it again. It tastes like liquified fruity pebbles.
Yeah. I noticed that too
What have I done?!
And, really, it's just a really weird thing to say to someone.
3) It's insulting to *all* women because it defines the standards of what a woman should look like (I just happen to fit within that)
2) It suggests I'm trying to hide being trans and trick people into not knowing that fact about me.
Come on, bro. 1) It suggests I was born a man, which literally zero people are born as. We're all born babies.
No need to worry, folks. A man stepped in to correct me.
Yes, I know, I'm the 978263482376th person to make that joke
Bill O'Reilly shouldn't worry too much, he can still have a career as POTUS
Good luck! Report back
like how could this possibly turn out good. they can do nothing but let me down. i'd expect too much.
do not want.
This happens to me every year in Disney. It's super weird.
"I would have never known you were born a man" #ThingsOnlyTransWomenHear
I've had this exact thing happen to me
I've been starving myself all week to get back to sports bra shape for the weekend. There's zero chance I'm running in a shirt
Yeah, it's gonna be a hot one. Glad I had no plans on "racing" it.
please
can't wait to see you there! I get down on Friday.

WHOA! Congrats!! üéâ
but you did it! You ran Boston!!
Tumblr volleyball team is about to play its first game. This is gonna be silly.
Just feels like I've been constantly bouncing from from one injury/near-injury to another for the last six months.
But it's really messing up my training for Grandma's and I've been back and forth on running on it all day.
The thing about my hip is that it's either extremely fucked or maybe not really that bad and I have no idea which one it is.
I love it!
YAY! Congrats!
Never change, Never change.
It's a really great race to spectate for! So inspiring to be there
One of our elevators broke with four people trapped in it and we're all watching live video of the dramatic rescue
What the hell is going on in Atlanta?!
No, totally, I respect it! I'm just saying it doesn't seem to work out well for American women who say they're going for the win
I don't either
Really bummed Des didn't do better. I think if you're an American woman, you need to not say you're going for the win in Boston. #Boston2017
And amazing third place finish for Hasay! #Boston2017
Great win for Kiplagat! #Boston2017
I just can't get excited for Galen Rupp. #Boston2017
That Kiplagat water stop. Sheesh. #Boston2017
Will NEVER tire of seeing that photo of #Boston2017
So, uh, Kiplagat is going for it here, huh? #Boston2017
Next year! Gah, I can't wait
He is!
Did Rupp just step on Mutai? #Boston2017
This is how Des races. She doesn't get caught up in pace surges by the lead pack. #Boston2017
DES!!!!
Too early for this race to be this stressful to watch. üò¨ #Boston2017
Damn, Des and Meb both dropping back :( #Boston2017
6 minute PR for and she was only 4th. WOW. #Boston2017
Seems like it's mostly just that everyone else fell in line with her and she's running her own race #Boston2017
Beating Tatyana McFadden is impressive on its own, but to beat her by *minutes* is absolutely wild. #Boston2017
Such a beautiful sight
"whoever gets there first is going to take the win"

Huh, is that how it works? #boston2017
Des is looking *really* calm and controlled like she's just out for an easy long run #Boston2017
She always runs *her* race. If she's out front, that means everyone else is falling in with her
Des being out front is reminding me too much of Shalane in 2014. Hoping it doesn't end up being a repeat of that. #Boston2017
Probably the best human on the planet, tbh
REALLY strange to be seeing Deba dropping off the back of the lead pack. #Boston2017
It's really weird to see Des out front leading the pack #Boston2017
I'm going to miss Meb so much when he retires ‚ù§Ô∏è#boston2017

She was running in Jeptoo's shadow for years. It's her time to shine now

Yes, you are quite crazy. However, the sizes are also out of order
Uh how?
Don't be silly, Cher. It's one or the other.
you because yes
But i don't want to fight you
I almost faved this for the gif before seeing what you said and now I refuse to fave. HOW COULD YOU FALL ASLEEP?!
omg why did I tweet that
My vagina became a penis again just so I could have a boner for this trailer

I wish I had a lacrosse ball right now. My hip could really use it.
Uncool!
Geez, everyone's gotta make some sort of comment when you're foam rolling in the middle of your office
I'm more jealous of people heading to #BostonMarathon this year than ever before. Having to wait until next year is killing me right now!
A giant bomb is what freedom looks like? huh?
Hating myself for paying $15 for express shipping bc I waited all week to actually place the order for some clothes I'll probs return anyway
The exciting thing about this president is that now I have to check to make sure WWIII hasn't started before I tweet anything non-serious
It's 10pm, do you know where your kitties are?
East Coast is where it's at, though!
Also, come move to NYC and work at Tumblr after you graduate :)
Yeah, getting stuck on stuff at work is good. It means you're being challenged. Though, it can be frustrating.
I get leg compliments a lot and I'm like "but they're short &amp; stubby" but then I look at all the muscle and I'm like BADASS!
Slack statuses are just a new way for Tumblr employees to shitpost. immediately tried to do the Bee Mov‚Ä¶
I hate to be the one to tell you, but you'll get stuck on things a lot more out of college

I don't watch the show, but it sounded terrible. I wish this kind of thing didn't keep happening.
You know how I feel about spice
Slack DMs with

Is there a link with all the info?
The worst part of marathon training is, without a doubt, the insatiable appetite you get a few weeks in.
Like where do you even start with this?
I'll shoot you a DM in a few!
I didn't even know about the meetup!
Oof, yeah. I'm used to runDisney races in January so I'm a little worried about this weather

"It thinks my penis is a cactus."

An actual sentence I just said that I hope will not be shared out of context.
Any time you out a trans person, you are sharing private information about them and putting their safety at risk. Don't do it.
And beyond safety, maybe I just don't really want that on that table sometimes? Maybe I just wanna be like a normal person.
That safety isn't something you can evaluate for another person.
When I out myself somewhere or to someone, it's only after I've deemed it safe enough to do so.
I'm a preeeeetty out trans women. Like as out as you can be. But it's still my thing to share, not yours.
Don't out trans people. Ever. Just don't, okay?
It's okay, I'd eat it too
Same! It always felt really weird to me!
That guy was basically Snape's son
You gotta have code to have bugs. Just sayin'
Well, of course, women don't actually like sci-fi
I hear there's also a really cool podcast about it too!

It's okay to criticize things/people you like. Your affinity towards someone/something shouldn't make them off limits or lower your bar
Empowerment you have to pay for is just a cult.
Feminism isn't immunity from criticism
None of this is true except immigrants not wanting to come here anymore. What's it like to be this insecure?
they're just okay. 6 out of 10
Fuck.

What?! Since when is the US Canada? #bibchat
Can be topped with tomatoes and avocado which are healthy. The meat has protein! Healthy! #bibchat

So I guess the media is just gonna suck the hell out of Trump's dick now that he's fired off a bunch of missiles. Cool. üò°
e.g. large companies making large job announcements.
He hasn't done anything good, but he takes credit when good things he had nothing to do with happen.
Remember when he said he cared about Syrian children this week?
Trump will blame this on Obama and "the mess he inherited." Good things are his doing, bad things are Obama's fault.

11/ If you want to actually be inclusive, you need to make products people can afford.
10/ Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs great to see marginalized ppl getting visibility in marketing campaigns,but maybe capitalism is just always bad
9/ And this isn‚Äôt to say only white women have money or all white women do, but‚Ä¶well, wealth is extremely disproportionately distributed.
8/ Being inclusive is more than just putting a trans/Muslim/black woman in an ad or talking up one or two athletes.
7/ you to sell clothes cheaper, it‚Äôs on you to either figure out how to make it happen or stop claiming to be so inclusive.
6/ If you wanted to make products for all women, your price points would be lower. If you‚Äôre a smaller company and your scale doesn‚Äôt allow
5/ When your tank tops cost $50+, you‚Äôre making it clear that despite what you say, your primary demographic is white women with money.
4/ Between shorts, a tank, sports bra, shoes, socks, and headband, that can easily approach $300 for one outfit. That‚Äôs not inclusive.
3/ Yet at the same time, their products cost more than anyone who isn‚Äôt upper middle class can afford.
2/ Companies will make inclusive advertising or their CEOs will talk about how important it is to make products for *all* women
1/ It really bugs me when running clothing/shoe companies talk about being inclusive, but price most marginalized ppl out of their products.

The whole thing is so absurd that it can't even be reasoned with in any rational way
You only need to respect those who are real
But, being that I'm not real, that means I'm not subject to humanity's rules or the laws of physics.

So basically, watch the fuck out!
It's true, actually, I'm not real.

I exist solely in humanity's collective imagination as a reminder of its inner depravity.
Yawn.
To be fair, it's not just spreadsheets. It's literally anything that allows people to enter text/photos/gifs

I went back inside without running. I hate myself so much right now, but I lost all will to go out there and run.
It was taking forever and just not catching. After ten minutes, I got tired of the cold wind blowing on me and said fuck it.

The Oxford comma is a hill I would probably literally die on

Hah. This is the least surprising thing ever
Actually, I call things gay all the time now, too. But now they're the things I like.
I'm pretty sure I did this while in college.
You can't let it destroy you,though. We have to remember we can't change the past, but we can use it to be better going forward
Same! I think about it every day. I wish I could undo those things. I wish I could fix the past.
That last tweet is missing an Oxford comma. I'm very upset about this. I wish we could edit tweets. :(
Many of us were probably some of the worst offenders of this as we tried to overcompensate for who we are
Instead of denying it, accept it and work towards breaking down the cultures that taught you that hate, bigotry and oppression.
So, yes, you have said (and probably also written) racist, homophobic, transphobic, etc things in your life.
Bigotry is learned, but it starts at the earliest points in our lives, before we're mature enough to fully grasp, question, or understand it
When bigotry is cultural we become unknowing perpetuators of it before we're old enough to be able to question it.
I mean, even I'm not even close to innocent here.
If *anyone* says "I have never written a single homophobic or transphobic word in my life,‚Äù they're lying.
Man, I guess you didn't see the looks on her face that we all saw in the *video*

This is true. This is also saying A LOT

It's funny because my favorite racing distances and favorite training/fun distances are mutually exclusive from each other
Any training run longer than 13 miles feels like torture to me and I dread it for days to come

This is good.
Cognitive dissonance is strong. It's easier to write things off than to examine you believe, accept you may be wrong
Of course, all these tweets I'm sending are pointless. You won't change you mind. You don't care about these things
But, again, you need to be able to see things more than one step out. More than the surface.
Almost all of Trump's policies can be broken down in a similar fashion to how they actually hurt anyone who isn't rich
Things have downstream effects
But see, in order to understand that, you need to be able to think beyond the immediate and obvious
When the US coasts are flooded in a few decades, rich people will just move. Poor people will be stuck
And because of income disparity, black people are dispropotionately poor compared to white people
Rich people can afford to just move when things get bad in an area. Poor people cannot.
Over longer terms, the EPA (and climate change research/action) ensure livability of our land
That hurts poor people
Not having clean drinking water means people have to *buy* bottled water at a significant cost relatively
EPA does things like I don't know ensure there's clean drinking water
you simply look for ways to reduce things to their immediate dollar cost
Problem with Republicans is y'all don't think about things over the long term or broader impact
Removing EPA will kill black people and many other poor people
The Oxford comma is good!
The Oxford comma is good!
Maybe America isn't actually a great nation
Except I'm not mad? But don't fall back on that whole joke like because your hypocrisy is is showing. You meant what you said
You're saying liberals should pay for the things *you* don't like.All I did was rework that to be about the things we don't like
Also, you're too dense to even get the argument here, aren't you?
Oh, right, because Mexico is never paying for that wall as Trump had promised they would.
Is it good?
Then you'll have no problem funding that stupid wall on your own. And Melania living in NYC. And Trump's trips to Mar-a-lago.

Anna is cool. I suggest that you work with her. I did and it was awesome.
I watched this right before I walked out the door. Holy hell was that kick amazing! #London2017
Okay, Donald, I'll be traveling for the next two weeks. Try to like, I don't know, not do anything crazy so I can enjoy my trip.

Hoooooly shit. Sooner or later the tech industry is going to have to get serious about making people like this feel‚Ä¶
OMG I need to see this
I saw two flies having sex on the railing up the front steps this morning. It was a like a damn Alkaline Trio song.
There is no hope for this company
Nope.

You know you're a runner when the most exciting part of traveling is running along the routes you've drawn out on Strava
I‚Äôm still smiling from this morning‚Äôs epic thunderstorm. It was so nice to wake up to.
Getting in on the #LGBTbabes action
This is exactly how it happened
After two weeks with a 10.5‚Ä≥ iPad Pro, I find it intensely annoying just how much I‚Äôm loving this thing. It‚Äôs absolutely fantastic.
I have *a lot* of issues with this ranking of New Jersey‚Äôs malls. It‚Äôs all wrong.
Not everything needs to be "smart."

Whoever thought this was a good idea should feel bad about their life choices.
You sure wouldn't know it by looking around this country
Not sure which camera lens/lenses to bring to Europe. 50mm f/1.4 and/or 24-105mm f/4L. I‚Äôm only bringing a backpack &amp;my Canon 6D ain‚Äôt light
Wait‚Ä¶it‚Äôs August?

Really?

Fuck.
If we lose net neutrality, this means smaller sites who can‚Äôt pay for ‚Äúfast lanes‚Äù might have links to their sites‚Ä¶

A very rough diagram of what our bed looked like last night. #catlife
I run through a marina every morning and there‚Äôs this one model of sailboat there are two of that is absolutely gorgeous‚Ä¶

I'd be into this
Great, but I don't see corporations making more money as a good thing.
Hold up, is it not normal to wear a pair of jeans for a month+ between washes?
The truest of statements. Like I don't even know what y'all are doing half the time.
What a dumb country this is
Well, that didn't last long.
Buy this for all of your water drinking friends
I‚Äôm a straightshooter, as they say.
And people wonder why I refuse to register as a Democrat or call myself one.
When üçÜ isn‚Äôt in my recent emoji list, I‚Äôm failing my personal brand
Should I buy a selfie stick for my trip to Europe?
This marathon training cycle is v weird feeling. Maybe it‚Äôs just bc of everything else going on, but I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm in training mode
I spy Tumblr HQ‚Äôs roof deck in this photo. I do miss that view.
That‚Äôs nice. All the stocks I own are down.

I‚Äôm 48oz deep in iced coffee already today so yeah I wouldn‚Äôt mess with me
Status: eating the best coffee cake I've ever had in my life   This thing is life changing
Or maybe don't run for what's most impressive and instead run what you enjoy the most. I don't marathon to impress.‚Ä¶
Ecto Cooler and tequila
While I still don‚Äôt yet trust cis people to stand up and fight for our rights, this week gave me some hope for the future. /1
Today was my first decent long run since before Grandma‚Äôs Marathon. Thank you, cool weather.
Tumblr friends, can one of you hook me up with one of those Tumblr spinners? I‚Äôd like one please.
Trump demands complete loyalty from everyone he works with, but will never show an ounce of loyalty to anyone in return
This is something we should be cheering. This is how a civilized society functions.
Holy shit
Take a run at everyone. Literally all of them.
While ppl are praising McCain, maybe remember he could have single-handedly allowed you to sleep last night by voting no in the first place
This country is so fucked up that waking up to find out you still have healthcare is exciting and good news
I woke up to news that McCain found some semblance of a spine last night.

Everything about this country is so absurd right now.
Going to bed now, but I guess I'll be waking up to find out no one has healthcare anymore?

Obviously.
Transphobe: *unfounded, factualy incorrect garbage*
Me: provable facts based on actual science, medicine, and history.
T: you're delusional
When you're straight up schooling someone on Twitter, but they just can't quit your mentions
Transphobes are OBSESSED with other people's genitals. They are perverted sexual predators.
I asked to be treated like a human
How do you know what genitals someone has? What are *you* doing in the bathroom???
"Please ask nicely to be treated like a human being"
If you require marginalized people to be polite in order to care about them, you're not an ally, you're a problem.
Not now, Emoji Movie. Not now.
Not now, Emoji Movie. Not now.
Sigh nice.
If you're a white cisgender dude, maybe don't show up to a protest for trans people to argue with a trans person while saying you support us
We have ice cream on our side.

You hear that, Trump? We got ice cream.
I *did* have plans for tonight, but now I have to protest instead.

NYC friends, please come support my community‚Ä¶
Where do I send the bill for all the productivity I‚Äôve lost in the last two years because of Donald Trump?
At least something not awful happened today?
I *hate* being called brave because of anything related to being trans, but this is factually correct
These two strangers are talking about Trump on the park bench next to me.

‚Äúhe‚Äôs a gangster!‚Äù
‚Äúhe sounds like Adolf Hitler!‚Äù
Cis people really hate us a lot.

Those of you who are allies and support trans people, it‚Äôs a good time to make sure you‚Äôre showing that.
It's not about the military or bathrooms, it's about our ability to exist in and be a part of society and the world around us
This is not a distraction. Trans people are people. With lives that matter.
The right is always accusing the left of playing identity politics, but it's the right that is utterly *obsessed* with trans people
Trump and the GOP are dismantling this country piece by piece
Anyone want to tell Trump how many people in the military he just said "fuck you" to?
"Trump will be great for LGBT people"
I'd like to be able to look away from the internet for like ten seconds without something awful happening while I'm gone
I'm unemployed and have a busier day
Hey, I did my part
She thinks she has the moral high ground here
If you‚Äôre a Republican in Congress you are a worthless and evil human being. Zero exceptions.
Fuck every single Republican voter
Fuck every single Trump voter
Fuck McCain
Fuck Trump
Fuck McConnell
Fuck the GOP
Mitch McConnell is the single worst human being on the planet. And that is saying A LOT.
It‚Äôs also what provides the most results
It‚Äôs really not that hard. It‚Äôs going to be okay, Steven. I promise.

Would love to know what my bot is referring to here
This damn goober
I have a really hard adult decision to make right now and my heart and brain are in disagreement. Ugh.
This is one of my biggest pet peeves
My run this morning suuuuuucked. Is summer over yet?

The thing about my Googleability and the experience on my resume is ppl already know I‚Äôm trans before I even walk into interview
